            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therfore haue I neither thruſt in many examples / nor gone out of my matter to entreat generally of vice and vertue / whiche were a large felde to walke in: vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de that my boke myght be nat only redde without tediouſnes: but alſo be redde often. More ouer though the precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for men be innumerable: women yet maye be enfourmed with fewe wordes. For men muſt be oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cupied both at home &amp; forth abrode / bothe in theyr owne matters and for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale. Therfore hit can nat be declared in fewe bokes / but in many and longe / howe they ſhall handle them ſelfe in ſo many and diuers thynges. As for a woman hath no charge to ſe to / but her honeſtie and chaſtyte. Wherfore whan ſhe is enfurmed of that / ſhe is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appoynted. Wherfore theyr wyckednes is the more curſed and deteſtable / that go about to periſſhe that one treaſure of women: as though a man had but one eie / and an other wolde go about to put it out. Some wryte fylthye and baudye ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. Whiche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I can nat ſe what honeſte excuſe they can ley for them ſelfe: But that theyr corrupt mynde / and ſwelled with poyſon / can breathe non other thyng but venom / to diſtroye them that are nere vnto hit. But they call them ſelfe louers / and I beleue they be ſo in dede / ye and blinde &amp; madde
<pb facs="tcp:181141:7"/>to withall. And though thou loue / canſt thou nat opteyne thyne owne / except thou infecte all other therfore? In my mynde no man was euer banyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed more ryghtfully / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was Ouide / at leſt wiſe if he was baniſſhed for writyng the crafte of loue. For other write wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ton and noughty balades / but this worſhipful artificer / muſt make rules in god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dis name &amp; preceptes of his vnthriftines / a ſchole maiſter of baudry / &amp; a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon corrupter of vertue. Nowe I doubt nat but ſome wyll thynke my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes ouer ſore and ſharpe. Howe be it the nature of all thynges is ſuche / that the way of vertue is eaſy and large vnto good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / and the way of vice contrarye / ſtrayte and roughe. But vnto yll men neither the way that they go in is pleaſant / nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waye of vertue large and eaſy inough: and ſeyng it is ſo / hit is better to aſſent vnto good men than ill: and rather to reken y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bad folkes opinion falſe / than the good mennes. Pythagoras the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher / &amp; other of his ſchole / in the deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this letter. Y. ſay / that whan a man is paſte the fyrſte difficulte of vertue / all after is eaſy and playne.</p>
            <p>Plato gyueth cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle to choſe the beſt way in ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uynge: whiche way vſe &amp; cuſtome ſhall alſo make pleaſant. Our lorde in the goſpell ſaythe / that the way into the kyngdome of heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſtrayte / nat by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo in dede / but bycauſe fewe go it: except a man wold cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his wordes falſe / where he ſaith: My yocke is ſwete and my burthen lyght. Orels where he promyſeth / that there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goth any thynge for his ſake / but he ſhall haue far
<pb facs="tcp:181141:7"/>more for it agayne / yea and that in this lyfe. And what was ment therby / but the pleaſures of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Therfore I ſe vnto whom my preceptes ſhal ſeme rigorous and ſharpe / that is yonge me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / that be ignorant / wanton and vnthriftye: whiche can nat ones beare the ſyght of a good woman. And lyke as ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke horſes neye vnto euery mare / ſo they go about euery tryflyng &amp; pyuyſſhe wenche / that hath a pleaſure to be loked vpon &amp; loued. and they wolde haue theyr folye to be allowable by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tytude of myſdoers. As who ſayth / the agrement &amp; abuſion of people myght chaunge the nature of thynges. Hit is no newes / that il folke hate them that auyſe them well. For Theophraſte whan he wrote of this ſame matter / &amp; ſpake moche of mari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>age ſadlye and wyſely / he ſette commen harlottis in his toppe. And one Leontium the concubyne of Metrodorus / ſtarted out and babled forthe a boke without all reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / or ſhame / agaynſt that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt excellent in wiſedome and eloquence: whiche dede was thought ſo intollerable / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as though no more hope of goodnes were lefte / ther roſe vp a ꝓuerbe of that matter / that the nexte remedy was to ſeke a tre to go hange vpon. Saynt Hierome wryteth of hym ſelfe vnto the holye mayde Demetrias in this wyſe: More than thyrty yere ago / I wryte a boke of virginite / in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche I muſt nedes ſpeke agaynſt vice and patefy the trappes of the deuyl / for the inſtruction of the maide that I taught: the whiche wrytyng many be agreued withal: whan euery one taketh the matter / as ſaid by hym ſelfe /

For by that meanes the loue ſhall be the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the mother and the daughter / whan none of the mothers name ſhall be taken from her and put vnto any other. For nurces be wonte alſo to be called mothers. And the mother maye more true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reken her daughter her owne / whom ſhe hath nat onely borne in her wombe and brought in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde / but alſo hath caried ſtyll in her armes of a babe / vnto whom ſhe hath gyuen tete / whom ſhe hath nouriſſhed with her owne blod / whoſe ſlepes ſhe hath cheriſſhed in her lappe / and hath cherful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Habacuch caryed the meate of the reapers vnto Daniell in Babylon / whiche was brede baken vnder the aſſhes / and a cuppe of water was ſente vnto Helie from heuen to refreſhe hym with: and yet might god haue ſente from he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen partryges / and pheſauntes / and capons / and marche payns / as well as breade: but holy folkes nede noriſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to holde the ſoule in the body / and nat to drowne hit with. What ſay philoſophers / &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſters of worldly wiſedome / al ſpeke of meate that is eaſy to gette / to kepe the mynde ſobre and the body chaſte. Socrates the father of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie dyd get by ſobre dyet / that he was neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with any ſore or ieoꝑdous ſicknes. Alſo Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Tacitus wryteth / that Senec the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in all his ryches fedde hym ſelfe with frute &amp; water: &amp; therfore his body was brought ſo lowe / that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his veynes were opened / there wolde al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moſt no blode re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne out.

<pb facs="tcp:181141:31"/>Plato in his lawes forbyddeth yonge men wyne.

Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Claudia / a religious virgin / was reputed for a mys woman / bycauſe ſhe vſed to weare gaye ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Whiche lawe indured vntyl the great outragious ſuperfluite came in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie / whan women came runnynge forthe / as though they had be madde / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:38"/>aſkynge a lycence to weare what they lyſte. But Marcus Cato / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great wyſe man / gaue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle contrary / with an oration ful of wyſdome: and .ii.

But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> women ouercame with theyr importunite and buſines / that the bryddel of their pride might be let ſlyppe / that they myght do what they luſte: Wherof what hurt ſhulde come Cato tolde before: and as in many of his other ſayenges / like wiſe in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was a true prophet. For what man can tell / howe great a loſſe is of chaſtite / cauſed by this ſtri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uynge for apparelle / whan euery one is aſhamed to be ouer come of her felowe in rayme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be trymmed and dekked / than deſyre they to go forthe amonge men to ſhewe them ſelfe. And there in is the ſhyppe wracke of chaſtite. Plutar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus ſaythe / that it is a cuſtome in Egypte / that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhulde weare no ſhowes / bicauſe they ſhuld abyde at home. Lyke wyſe if thou take from wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſylke / and cloth of golde / and ſyluer / precious ſtones / and gemmes / thou ſhalte the more eaſily kepe them at home. Alſo he reherſeth .ij. ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / the one of Sophocles the poet / and the other of Crates the philoſopher. Sophocles ſpeketh of riche orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes thus: That is none ornamene y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wretche / but a ſhame and a manyfeſt ſhewe of thy foly. Crates ſaythe / that is an ornament / whiche exalteth: and a woman is exalted with that / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che makethe her more honeſte: But that doethe neyther golde / nor perle / nor pourple / but ſuche

Democrates ſaythe, that the adoruament of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtandeth in ſcarſite of ſpeche and apparell: In whiche opinion Sophocles is. And amonge the Grekes this was a comon ſayenge / and in a maner of a prouerbe: The adornamet of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nat golde / but conditions. Alſo Ariſtotell / the moſte wyſe philoſopher / byddeth women vſe leſſe apparell than the lawe ſuffereth: and he byddeth them conſydre / that neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodlynes of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell / nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellence of beautie / nor thabundaunce of golde is of ſo great eſtemation in a woman / as is meaſurablenes and dylygence to lyue well and honeſtly in all thynges. And of the ſame opinion be the other wyſe men of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pagans / that a chriſten woman maye be a ſhamed to folowe pagans / nat thoſe ſage and wyſe men / nor thoſe vertuous and honeſt women / but the errour of foles &amp; enſample of madde women: and I confeſſe / that I can nat tell what honeſt colour women maye lay for theyr apparell / but only that they may ſeme fayrer / and entiſe men / whiche were a ſhame / ye for gentyles. Therfore thou bothe ſerueſt thy pride / and ſetteſt the deuylles nettes in thy body / to catche with all the ſoules of them / that beholde the: thou woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / nat a Chriſtiane / but the myniſter of the deuyll / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fell thretny<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of our lorde diſpleaſed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> / ſhalbe pronunced vpon the / ſayeng by Eſaie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet: Our lorde hath made balde the hedes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Syon / and in ſtede of ornament they ſhall haue ſhame / and for theyr ſhowes / and ſlyppers /

Theſe wordes our lorde ſayd of women. And this holy martyr ſaynt Cyprian ſayth: There be ſome ryche women and habundant in goodis / whiche beare theyr treaſure on them / and ſay they muſte vſe theyr goodes. Fyrſte let them knowe / that ſhe is ryche / that is ryche in god: and ſhe is habu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of poſſeſſions / that is habundant in Chriſte: and thoſe be good that be ſpirituall / diuine / and heuen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye / whiche ſhall abyde with vs in perpetuall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.

Thou boſteſt thy poſſeſſions and virginite: but a virgin ſhulde nat boſt her riches / ſeyng that holy ſcripture ſayth: What hath pride auayled vs? Or what good hath the boſt of riches done vs? All they be paſſed as a ſhadowe. Thou ſayſt y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> art ryche / and thynkeſt that thou muſt vſe
<pb facs="tcp:181141:39"/>thoſe that god wold thou ſhuldeſt haue / vſe them, why nat? But yet in goodnes &amp; good wayes / vſe them / in ſuche thynges as god commaunded / and as our lorde taught: Let them fele thy riches that haue nede: let them knowe the to be of power: get wynnynges vnto Chriſte of thy patrimony: fede god. This ſaythe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> martyr ſaynt Cyprian. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thynges are a great deale better for a chriſten woman to knowe and do / than that the paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do: and hit were mete for them to take hede vnto the philoſophers / and nat to folowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dedes of foles / and apply vnto the fantaſies of madde folkes: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte we wolde ſpende our lyfe madly and foliſhly. But here ſome man wold ſay: what / woldeſt thou haue women to be fylthy and ſluttyſſhe? Nay ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely / I wolde nat haue them ſo: nor my preceptes be nat ſo vnclene: nor I lyke nat ſluttiſhnes. And what maner a ones they ſhulde be / ſaynt Peter &amp; ſaynt Paule .ij. defenders of the churche / teache in .ij. ſhorte preceptes. Saynt Peter ſaythe: Let nat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward apparell of women be decked with the braydynge of her heare / nor with wrappynge of golde about hit / or goodly clothynge: but the mynde &amp; the conſcience / that is nat ſene with eies / if hit be pure and quiet / that is a goodly thynge / and excellent afore god. And ſaynt Paule ſaythe: women in theyr arraye ſhulde apparell them ſelfe with ſhamfaſtnes &amp; ſobrenes: &amp; nat with braydes of theyr heare / or golde / or perles / or precious clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: but as wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to do: Let them ſhewe vertue by good workes. Whan the apoſtles ſaye
<pb facs="tcp:181141:40"/>theſe wordes / they byd nat women be ſluttiſſhe &amp; ſlubbered / nor foule with dirte and clowtes: but they counſayle them from ſuperfluous rayment / and wyll them to vſe meane clothynge / and ſuche as is eaſy to comeby. For meſurablenes hath his clennes / and that farre more pure than the great exceſſe hath / as hit is more eaſy to kepe a litle veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great meyny.

Let nat her rayment ſhyne / ne let it nat be ſluttiſſhe: neither let hit nat be to be wondred on: nor let hit nat be to be lothed: as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wearyng of golde / or ſyluer / or perle / or precious ſtones / I ſe nat what hit is good for / ſauyng that the vertue of ſome ſtones is more ſette by than the ſhewe / as corall or emeraude: if at leſt waye thoſe lytell thynges haue ſo moche vertue in them as men ſay: but nowe mo ſeke them for vanite / that he may ſeme more ryche / than for the vertue. Nor let her nat peynte nor anoynt her face / but waſſhe hit &amp; make hit clene: nor dye her heare / but kome hit clenly: Nor let her nat ſuffre her heed to be full of ſcurfe: Nor let her nat delite to waſhe it in ſwete fauours: nor to kepe hit ſtynkynge: nor loke in a glaſſe to peynte her or try<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me her gayly by: but to haue away / if any foule thyng or vncomely be on her heed / that ſhe coude nat els ſe: and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let her aray her ſelfe therby / leſt any thyng be in her face to defoule her / beyng els chaſte and ſobre. Finally that whiche Socrates bad his ſcholers / lette her thynke ſpoken vnto her to / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhuld loke them
<pb facs="tcp:181141:40"/>in a glaſſe / and if they were fayre / that they ſhulde ſe leſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mynde were foule: and if they were foule / that with the beautie of the mynde they ſhuld cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhulde I diſpute with theſe folkes? What good man wyll alowe this? Or who wyll lyke hit / but ſuche as neuer knewe ſo moche as a ſhadowe of honeſtie? Whiche wolde if they coulde brynge hit to paſſe / haue all wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nought / that they myght the more eaſylye fulfylle theyr vnſatyable luſtes: Whiche be them ſelfe drowned vppe to bothe the eares in vice / vnhappynes / and vnthriftynes / that they can neither le theyr owne vice / nor other mennes. Fyrſte let them put of that curſed darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / where with they be ouer layden: and than ſhall we beleue theyr iudgementes of vertue. As for a yonge woman and a yonge man / to talke of loue in a corner / is nat mete / though they were bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therne and ſyſterne.

So Amon ſonne of kynge Dauid / defloured his owne ſyſter Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar: ſo Caunus lay by his ſyſter Byblis. Saint Auguſtine wolde neuer dwelle with his ſyſter in houſe: He ſayde hit was noughte to ſe a woman / worſe to ſpeke with her / and worſt of all to touche her.

Nor in a great courte I wolde they ſhulde nat crepe in to corners. What wolde they ſay there / that other folkes may nat heare: if they purpoſe to ſpeke of that / that is pure and chaſte? Neither I wolde there ſhulde be manye wordes betwene yonge men and maydes / though folkes be by / excepte they be ſo pure and honeſte / that no ſuſſpecte of ill can come of them. For ſome men be ſo crafty in noughtynes / &amp; can wrappe in darke ſentence theyr myndes in ſuche wyſe / that they maye yet be vnderſtanden of her what they meane / by that they ſpeke vnto her: and yet ſhall the double ſence cauſe / that they maye denye that they ment ſo / and blame her for wronge takynge theyr wordes / and vnderſtandynge them in euyll ſence / whiche they ſpake for no harme: and than they ſet moche by theyr owne witte: wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nyng in theſe craftes / though they be deuoyde of al goodnes / but able &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nyng inough to do yl: whiche thynge dothe nat proue any great wytte but an excerciſe in noughtynes: whiche as Senec

And if iudgement ſhulde be gyuen of thy diſpoſition / I had leauer yll folkes ſhulde reken the rude / than good folkes badde. Tell me howe moche redeſte thou in all the hiſtorie of the goſpell / that our lady euer ſpake. The angell cometh in vnto her: &amp; ſhe fyniſſhed the matter with fewe wordes / and thoſe wyſe and ſad / &amp; alſo holy: She gothe for to ſe Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabeth / &amp; ſpeketh to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preyſe of god: She bry<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth forth a ſonne / whiche is god: She is lauded of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> angelles / worſhyppedde of the hyrde menne / and holdethe her peace / gatherynge and kepynge in her remembraunce all theyr ſayenges. She was honored of the wyſe men of the eaſte / that came thyther a great waye: and what doſte thou rede / that euer ſhe ſpake? Some other pauenture wold haue aſkedde of theyr countre / of theyr treaſure / of theyr lernynge / or of the ſterre: but ſhe / as be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>came a yonge mayde / ſpake neuer a worde.

The olde man tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his ſayenge vnto the mayde / ſpekynge of her ſonne: Lowe he is put for a falle and a ryſynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne of many in Iſrael / &amp; a ſyng / ayenſt whom there ſhall be ſpekynge / and a ſworde ſhall cut thy harte / vnto thende that the thoughtes of many hartes in Iſrael may be opened. Some other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wolde haue aſked / whan / howe / and where hit ſhulde haue bene: but we rede nat / that ſhe ſaid any thynge. She loſte her dereſte ſonne at Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: and whan ſhe had ſought hym thre dayes / and at the laſte founde hym / howe many wordes ſayd ſhe to hym? Sonne / why haſte thou ſerued vs ſo? Lothy father and I ſought the carefully, After that whan ſhe was of more age / at a mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age / ſhe ſayd no more but this: Sonne they haue no wyne. And at the croſſe ſhe was clene dumine: ſhe aſked neuer a whytte of her ſonne / neither with whom he wolde leaue her / nor what he wold commaunde her to do / whan he dyed: For ſhe had nat lerned to pratle amonge folkes. All maydes / &amp; al wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> folowe you her: for ſhe was but of fewe wordes: but wonderous wiſe. Theano Metapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina a poet / and a mayde excellent counnynge / re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened / that ſilence was the nobleſte ornament of a woman. And Sophocles is of the ſame opyny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for with ſilence bothe wyſedome and chaſtite be ſwetely poudered. Thou arte none atturney of lawe good doughter / nor pleadeſte nat in courte / that thou ſhalte nede to quaple either thyn owne / or thy clyentes matter / excepte thou ſpeke. Holde
<pb facs="tcp:181141:56"/>thou thy peace as boldly as other ſpeke in courte: and ſo ſhalte thou better defende the matter of thy chaſtite / whiche afore iuſte iudges ſhall be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with ſilence than with ſpeche. We rede in hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries / that a childe was ones brought in to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men place of the cyte at Rome vpon a matter of chaſtite / and with holdyng downe his eies / on the grounde / and ſtyll ſilence / defended his matter better than he ſhulde haue done with longe orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of orators. But nowe to ſpeke of women / ſaint Suſan excuſed her ſelfe of the cryme of adulterye with ſilence / and nat with wordes. Nowe let vs here ſaint Ambroſe. The holy woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Suſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> helde her peace / and ouer came her enemies: for ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſended nat her ſelfe with reſonynge of wordes / nor with ſpeche of any atturney / but the holy woman her ſelfe holdyng her tonge / her chaſtite ſpake for her. Alſo in the boke of virgins he ſaythe on this wyſe: I had leauer a mayde ſhulde loue to lytle talke than to moche: For if women be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to holde theyr peace of holy matters in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che / and aſke theyr huſbandes at home / what ſhuld maydes do / ſuppoſe you / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> while / in whom ſhamefaſtnes garnyſheth theyr age / and ſtylnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth theyr ſhamefaſtnes?

Wherfore many wyſe men toke occaſion of that / to gyue preceptes / that men ſhulde neuer commytte theyr counſaile vnto women / neither to his ſyſter / his mother / nor his wyfe / but this is but a vice of ſome / and nat of the holle kynde as hath appered by example of dyuerſe / as that woman of Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras ſchole and ſecte / that byt of her owne tonge and ſpytte out in the face of the tyrant / that dyd

I lette paſſe here the women of Mylete / whiche kepte theyr huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des counſaile at Maſſyle many a day / ſo longe as was neceſſarye. Tacitus writeth / that Epicaris bycauſe ſhe was of counſayle of the treaſon that Piſo wente about / was commaunded to be haled with turme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / to cauſe her for to ſhewe. The fyrſt day ſhe was attaſted with beatynge and fyre / and that the more greuouſly / bycauſe the turme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tours were angrye / that a woman ſhulde ſet them at ſo lyghte: yet for all that ſhe was nat ones moued / nor wolde nat confeſſe that ſhe knewe any thynge. The nexte daye ſhe was broughte vnto the ſame paynes agayne / and was caryed vp in a chayre / bicauſe her bones were ſo haled in ſunder / that ſhe coude nat ſtande / and there ſhe toke a towell / that was tyed about her breaſt / and faſtened hit to the toppe of the chayre in maner of a ſnare / and putte in her necke / and there hanged by hit with all the weight of her body / and wronge out that lytle lyfe that ſhe had. We rede in the hiſtories of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienſes / that the concubyne of Ariſtogiton / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che banyſſhed Piſiſtrotes children / called Leena by name / whan ſhe was haled vpon tourments / to ſhewe where her louer was / ſhe ſuffred al thing ſtyll and paciently. If that harlottes and nough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty women dyd thus / what ſhulde we ſuppoſe good women wolde do? Let nat the mayde be ouer bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye in a nother bodies houſe / neither riffle vp and ſerche euerye corner: nor deſyre to haue or knowe

And it is a worlde to ſe howe demurely &amp; ſadlye ſome ſyt / beholding them that dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / &amp; with what geſture / paſe / and mouynge of the bodye / and with what ſobre footynge / ſome of them daunce. Wherin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a man may ſpye a great parte of their foly: that go about to handle ſuche a foliſſhe thynge ſo ſadly: neyther ſe them ſelfe haue a matter in hande with out any wyſedome / neyther any thynge worthe / but as Cicero ſaythe a companion of vicis. What holy woman dyd we euer rede of / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was a dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſer?

For they knowe wel inough / it is a foliſſhe thyng / or els they wolde do hit of theyr owne courage. But they wyll nat be gladde to come where daunſynge is. For what chaſtite of bodye and mynde can be there / where they ſhall ſe ſo many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes bodies / &amp; haue theyr myndes entyſed by the wyndowes of theyr eies /

There is alſo a certayne ſayeng of an holy man / that he had leauer plowe and dygge vpon the holy day / than daunce.

What coulde the doughter lerne more of her mother / whiche was an harlotte / but to leaſe her honeſtie. For nothyng inclyneth folke more to bodily luſte / than by vncomly mouyng &amp; geſture / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:61"/>to ſhewe the operation of theſe parties / whiche ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature hath hid ſecretly / or good maner and nourture hath couered: or to play caſtis with her eies / or ſhake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> necke / or ſwynge her heare.

Alſo after that Ruth had borne the prophet Eſai by her ſeconde huſbande called Booz / women dyd make as great ſemblaunce of gladnes vnto Noe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye / as though ſhe had had of her owne dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or her owne ſonne / nat onely one neuew / but as though ſhe had hadde ſeuen ſonnes her ſelfe: For they ſayd to her in this maner: Ther is one borne nowe of thy doughter in lawe / whiche ſhall loue the and be better vnto the / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſeuen ſonnes.

Nowe wil I ſpeke a fewe wordes of loue / the whiche doteth all maydes for the mooſte parte / &amp; diſceiueth them greatly / and bryngeth to moche miſchiefe. For hit dothe nat become amayd to make any ſigne / that ſhe wold fayne be maried / or that ſhe loue any yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge man to wedde. For if ſhe loue hym afore or ſhe haue hym / that it be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / what ſhall he thynke / but that ſhe wyll as lyght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue another as ſhe hath done hym / whom as yet ſhe ought to ſhewe no loue vnto: neither he wil beleue that ſhe loueth hym alone / ſeynge there is as great cauſe to loue other. And if he ſhulde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie her / he wyll thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke ſhe wyll haue as good my<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to other as hym ſelfe / whan ſhe is ſo lyght of loue. Let euery body excuſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter as they wyll / but in very dede euery woman / that loue the any man veſyde her huſbande / is accurſed / if ſhe haue a do with hym: and though ſhe haue nat / yet is ſhe an harlotte in my<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. And there hath bene many that haue loued ſo outragiouſly / that they haue bene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto the pleaſure of thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / whom they hoped ſhulde be their huſbandes: And afterward y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men haue diſpiſed &amp; caſt them vp: whiche in my mynde was well and wyſely done. For they be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy for to be maried / that dare ſhewe an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto thoſe men / whom they ſhulde haue / howe well they can fynde in their harte to lye with a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / that is nat theyr huſbande. For by likelihode they wyll both do that ſame with other men afore their
<pb facs="tcp:181141:74"/>mariage / and in their mariage with theyr adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. There is no daye / wheron theſe thynges by chance nat in euery cite: nor there is no woman ſo ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t what is done in the cite / but ſhe hereth tell of theſe thynges. I haue harde tell in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre / that wowars haue bene forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for none other cauſe / but bycauſe there was no loue betwene the parties afore. For the yonge women ſayde / they coulde nat loue them / nor fynde in theyr harte to haue them in mariage / whom they loued nat / nor knewe before: and this is a great vſe they ſaye / in Candye. What nede is it to rebuke ſuche myndes with wordes / whiche who ſo dothe nat perceyue to be vnchaſte / I holde her farre more noughtye than they be. Nowe than loueſt nat thou thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande / bycauſe he is coupled vnto the by goddis lawes and goddis commandement / but bycauſe thou arte vſed to his loue before? So do drabbes and harlottis / whiche for lyke cauſe loue theyr lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: and thou arte nat farre vnlyke vnto thoſe drabbes. And ſo hit chanceth vnto ſuche women / euen by the punyſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of god / that all the loue / whiche they ought to kepe in theyr mariage / they ſpende it out afore. Wher of this common ſayenge came vp: that they that marie for loue / ſhall leade their lyfe in ſorowe. For it chanceth by many / that after the heate of loue is ones paſt / there foloweth great hate / whiche thyng ofte tymes maketh wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre and talke amonge the people / whan they here tell / howe ſo great louers within .iii. or .iiij. dayes fal at debate / and begynne to deuorce / or the bryde

For amonge yll folkes / as Cicero ſayth / can be no ſure frendſhippe. Wherfore hit is nat expedient to make maryages by loue afore hande / neither to couple and bynde that mooſte holy charite with ſo fylthy and brytell bandes: and yet moche worſe is it to make them to marye by ſtryuyng / and hate / thretnyng / and ſute: as whan they go to lawe to gether / the man for the woman / bearynge her in hande / that ſhe is his wyfe: and the woman in lyke maner for the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I neuer harde tell of more folyſſhenes / than for a woman to laboure to haue a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / agay<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt his wyll / with whom ſhe ſhall bothe lyue atwynne: and excepte he loue her / ſhe ſhall lyue in perpetuall ſorowe. And loue muſte be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with fayre meanes / and nat compelled: For he wyll neuer be a ſure frende / that is drawen and holden by force. What a madnes is hit to begynne that ſacrament of holy loue with hate? I wolde nat / ſo god me helpe / haue a ſeruant agaynſt his wyll: moche leſſe a mate: neyther hit is nat good to compell a man agaynſt his wyll: Nor I wolde the woman ſhulde be maryed vnto hym / excepte he deſyre her with all his harte: nor hit becometh nat the maydes fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des to pray or labour for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage / or ones to offre the mayde of theyr partye: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhulde ſeke for mariage: and ſo it ſhulde be done in dede / ſauyng that money ruleth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth all thynge. For nowe they be maryed vnto
<pb facs="tcp:181141:75"/>money / &amp; money marieth. And as Senec ſaythe / men drawe theyr wyues to them with theyr fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.

And as for the wyfe / the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande kepeth her but as his concubyne / and ſhe hym as aduoutrer: neyther loueth one another / but for the fylthy pleaſure of lechery: and elles ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hateth &amp; enuieth other.

Theſe two vertues / that I mean / be chaſtite and great loue towarde her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. The fyrſt ſhe muſte brynge with her forthe of her fathers houſe. The ſeconde ſhe muſte take after ſhe is ones entred in at her huſbandes dore / and bothe father and mother / kynſ folkes / and all her frendes lefte / ſhe ſhall reken to fynde all theſe in onely her huſbande. And in both theſe vertues ſhe ſhall repreſente the ymage of holye churche: whiche is both moſte chaſte and mooſte faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth kepe trouthe and promyſe vnto her ſpouſe Chriſte: whiche beynge ſolicited / and laboured within of ſo many wowers / that is to ſay / chriſten folkes / that haue ben commyn heritickes / and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyged without of pagans and Iewes: yet neuer hath bene wonne nor corruptedde: and hath euer rekenedde all her good and treaſure to reſte in her onely ſpouſe Chriſte. A maryed woman ought to be of greatter chaſtite than an vnmaryed. For if that thou than pollute and defile thy chaſtite / as god forbede thou ſhuldeſt / herke I pray the / howe

And I can nat thinke that gyfte very plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſant vnto god / where one gyueth away that / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che perteyneth vnto .ij.

Alſo the other vices be diſpleaſant in dede / but yet they may be ſuffred: but ſhe that breaketh the promiſe of wedlocke / is intollerable. Wherfore Homer the poet / amonge the curſynges and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:82"/>that he gyueth vnto certayne men / put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this for one of the foreſt: I pray god ſayth he / theyr wyues mutte medle with other men. Alſo Job prayeth / that if euer he lay in wayte to do his frendes diſpleaſure / this miſfortune myght light vpon hym / ſayeng: I pray god my wyfe may be an other mannes harlotte: and other men mutte lye downe vpon her. And theſe poyntes dyd nat only holy chriſten women vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / but alſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gannes: of whom there were ſome / whiche after they were corrupted / thought them ſelfe vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for to lyue / as Lucrecia / wyfe vnto Collatyne: whoſe acte is moſte famous / for the marueylous loue that ſhe had vnto chaſtite: and many moo / whiche leſte they ſhulde loſe theyr chaſtite / peryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed them ſelfe. What tyme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cite of Athens was wonne by Liſander the kynge of Lacedemon / and xxx. tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes were ſet to gouerne the cite / and they ruled moſte proudely and hautely / and iaped and mocked the honeſtie of many women / the wyfe of Niceratus ſlewe her owne ſelfe to eſcape / that ſhe ſhulde nat be at theyr fylthy pleaſure. Alſo the wy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues of the Almannes / of whom Caius Marius had ſlayne an infynite multitude / deſyred hym / that they might be gyuen vnto the religious mai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of Rome / called the virgins of Veſta / ſayeng / that they wolde lyue as chaſtely as they ſhulde: Whiche thynge whan they coulde nat optayne of that harde ſtomacke of Marius / all in the nyghte nexte enſuyng ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged them ſelfe. Alſo in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warre / whiche the people of Phoces had with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Theſſaly
<pb facs="tcp:181141:83"/>ans / and the Theſſalians came in to their countre with an incredeble power / Deiphantus the chiffe capitayne of the Phoceance / counſayled the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go agaynſt theyr ennemyes: but as for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren / theyr wyues / and aged me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / with other / that were nat able to beare harneis / to ſhutte them vp in ſome ſecrete place / and to brynge them plente of wodde &amp; ſtrawe / that &amp; if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ooſte were ouer come / they there myght burne them ſelfe. Nowe whan mooſte parte of the people conſented to the ſame / there roſe vp an aged man / whiche ſayd: It were well done to wytte the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes wyll in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: that if they agreed therto / than ſhuld it ſo be: if nat / he ſayde hit was vnreaſonable / to apoynt them ſuche a thynge agaynſt theyr wyll: where vpon the women were examyned / whiche anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all to gether / that they were very well agreed / with Deiphantus counſayle / and alſo gaue hym great thankes / bicauſe he had ſo well prouyded for the ſafegarde of them and of theyr countrey: and vpon this pourpoſe they were conueyed in to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create place: Nowe be it the Phocians retourned agayne with the victory: nor I doubt nat / but it was through the merite of the good women.

               <head>Howe ſhe ſhall behaue her ſelfe vnto her huſbande. The .iiii. Chaptre.</head>
               <p>HIt were alonge matter and harde to expreſſe / and therto wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous / if I ſhuld reherſe euery poynt of the wyues duetye vnto her huſbande: Our lorde comprehendeth it in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell with one worde. Therfore let vs remembre / howe we haue ſayd before / that ſhe is as one body with her huſbande. Wherfore ſhe oughte to loue hym none other wyſe than her ſelfe. I haue ſayde before / and ofte ſhal agayne: For this is the great teſt vertue of a maried woman: this is the thyng that wedlocke ſignifieth / and commaundeth that the wyfe ſhulde rekenne to haue her huſbande for bothe father / mother / bretherne / and ſyſters / lyke as Adam was vnto Eue / and as the moſte noble and chaſte woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Andromache ſaide her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de Hector was vnto her / in theſe wordes:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thou arte vnto me bothe father and mother</l>
                  <l>Myne owne dere huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / &amp; welbeloued brother.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And if it be true that men do ſaye / that frenſhyp maketh one harte of two: Moche more trewelye and effectually ought wedlocke to do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che farre paſſeth all maner bothe frendſhyppe and kynred. Therfore hit is nat ſayde that wedlocke dothe make one man / or one mynde / or one bodye of two / but clerely one perſon. Wherfore the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that the man ſpake of the woman / ſayeng / for her ſake a man ſhulde leaue bothe father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:84"/>and byde with his wyfe / the ſame wordes the woman ought bothe to ſaye and thynke with more reaſon. For all though there be one made of two / yet the woman is as doughter vnto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande / and of nature more weaker. Wherfore ſhe nedethe his ayde and ſuccoure. Wherfore if ſhe be deſtitute of her huſbande / deſart / and lefte alone / ſhe may ſone take hurte and wronge. Therfore if ſhe be with her huſbande / where he is / there hath ſhe bothe her countre / her houſe / her father / her mother / her frendes / and all her treaſure: of the whiche thynge Hipſicratea / wyfe vnto Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the kynge of Pontus / gaue good example / whiche folowed her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes aparayle / whan he was beaten and dryuen out of his la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / fleyng ſtyll from one place vnto an other / nat ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge / where to reforte or abyde: and where ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he was / ſhe acompted there to be her ryches / her realme / and her countrey. Whiche thynge doubtles was the greatteſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte and eaſe of his ſorowe and aduerſite. Flaccilla / wyfe vnto Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Priſcus / and Egnatia Maximilla wyfe vnto Glitto Gallus / both folowed their huſbandes out of theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre / whan they were banyſſhed / with great loſſe of treaſure and poſſeſſions: And they rekened theyr huſbandes farre aboue al thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Wherfore their names were had in great honour. Alſo Tauria deſerued no leſſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation / whiche wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de was outlawed / hydde hym vp betwene the ſilyng and the roffe of her chambre / no moo of counſayle but one mayde
<pb facs="tcp:181141:84"/>and her ſelfe: and ſo ſaued his lyfe with her owne great ieoperdy. Alſo Sulpitia wyfe vnto Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her mother Tullia watched her dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſte ſhe ſhulde folowe her huſbande / that was banyſhed / ſhe gotte vpon her poure rayment / and ſo with .ij. mayde ſeruauntes / and as many men / ſtale away and came to her huſbande: nor refuſed to banyſhe her owne ſelfe for his ſake / that her huſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bande myght ſe in his outlawry her faythfulnes towarde hym. And there haue bene very many / that hadde leauer be in ieoperdye them ſelfe / than theyr huſbandes ſhulde. The wyfe of Fernando Gonzalis therle of Caſtile / whan the kynge of the Legion of Germany / whiche is a cite in the parte of Spayne called Aſtury / hadde her huſbande in priſon / ſhe came vnto her huſbande / as it were to viſite hym / and there counſayled her huſbande to change rayme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with her / and ſteale his way / and leaue her in the ieoperdye that ſhulde falle: and ſo he dyd. Wherfore the kynge wondryng vpon that great loue of hers towarde her huſbande / prayed god to ſende hym and his chyldren ſuche wyues / and ſo let her go agayne to her huſbande. There was alſo an other of the ſame kynredde / whiche was maried vnto a certayne kynge of Englande / that what tyme her huſbande in warre agaynſte the Syryans / had catched a great wounde in his arme with a venomed ſwerde / and ſo came home in to his owne countre / nor coude neuer be healed / excepte that venome and matter were ſucked out: The kynge ſeynge that who ſo euer ſhulde do that
<pb facs="tcp:181141:85"/>dede / were in ieoperdy of their life / wolde ſuffre no man to take it vpon hym. Wherfore in the nyghte whan he was a ſlepe / his wyfe loſed the bandes of the wounde / fyrſt her huſbande nat perceyuynge / and after warde diſſemblyng / and ſo by lytell and lytel ſucked and ſpitted out the poyſon / and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the wounde curable and redy to the phiſition. Wherfore I am very ſory / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue nat the name of that noble woman / whiche were worthye to be commended with mooſte eloquent prayſes. Howe be it / it is nat vnſpoken of / for it is redde in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Spayne / whiche Rodericus the biſſhope of Tolet dyd write: From whenſe I ſhall ones tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate with honorable mention of her. Lyke wyſe vpon a ſeaſon men of Tyrthena came a great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out of their ile vnto Lacedemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / whom y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonyans ſuſpected to go about ſome ſubtilte / and ther vpon ſet them in holde / and iudged them to dye. Wherfore theyr wyues gate lycence of the kepers for to go in vnto them / as it were to viſete and comforte them / and there changed rayment with them / and ſo they in the womens rayment / and their faces couered / as the cuſtome of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre was / eſcaped awaye / and lefte their wyues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde them: whom afterwardes with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to gether they recouered agayne / and put all the Lacedemonyans in feare / as Plutarke wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. More ouer Admetus the kynge of Theſſaly / hauynge a dyſeaſe raynynge vpon hym / whiche coulde neuer be healed / without the dethe of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body / coude fynde none / that wolde gladly die
<pb facs="tcp:181141:85"/>for his ſake / but his wyfe Alceſt. Alſo many there hath bene / whiche after theyr huſbandes dethe / wolde in no wyfe abyde on lyue. Laodamia / after ſhe had harde tell that her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de Protheſilaus was ſlayne at Troy of Hector / ſhe kylde her ſelfe, And Paulina / wyfe of Senec / wolde fayne haue died with her huſbande / and had her vaynes cut / as he had / but ſhe was letted by Nero and holden agaynſt her wyll / tyll her armys were bounde / and her blode ſtopped: nor ſhe lyued nat many ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res after: And whyle ſhe was alyue / was ſo pale and ſo leane with ſorowe / that ſhe was a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der to euery man to loke vpon: and in all the ſtate of her body ſhewedde manifeſt tokens of the kynde loue that ſhe hadde to her huſbande. The doughter of Demotion / the chiefe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Areopagites / a yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge mayde / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe harde tell of the deth of her ſpouſe Leoſthenes / ſhe ſlewe her ſelfe: affyrmy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g / that all though ſhe was vntouched / yet bycauſe ſhe was maryed vnto hym in mynde / ſhe ſhulde be adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / if ſhe maryed vnto any other afterwardes. Olde wryters of ſtories tell / that Halcione wolde nat abyde on lyue after the dethe of her huſbande Ceyx: And therfore ſhe lepte downe in to the ſee. The fables of poetes / whiche were made to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructe out lyuy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges / adde more vnto the tale / that they were chaunged in to byrdes called Alciones: and ſo well beloued of the goddes Thetis / that whan ſo euer theſe byrdes buylde / there is great caulmenes in the ſee / and fayre wether in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayre: &amp; that chaunſeth yerely at certayne tymes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:181141:86"/>for thoſe dayes he called in laten Halcionii / that is as you wolde ſay / the Halcyon byrdes dayes: and that gyfte they ſay / the goddis gaue for the great loue of that woman towarde her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. Euad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na / whan ſhe kepte the funerall of her huſbande / ſhe lepte in to the fyre and folowed her huſbande. Cecinna Petus had a wyfe called Arria / this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinna / whan he had ryſen in batayle with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonian agaynſt Claudius themperour / and was brought to Rome / Arria deſyred the ſodiours to let her wayte vpon her huſbande as a ſeruaunt: whiche thynge whan they wolde nat ſuffre / ſhe hyred a fyſſhers boote / &amp; folowed the great ſhippe. And within a fewe dayes after the deth of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bande / kylled her ſelfe at Rome: and yet had ſhe a doughter on lyue maried vnto Thraſea / the moſt noble and wyſeſt man in his tyme. Portia dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Cato / wyfe vnto Marcus Brutus / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her huſbande was ſlayne / ſhe ſought for her owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the: and whan weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were taken from her / ſhe thruſte hote coles in her mouthe / and choked her ſelfe. Panthia / wyfe of kynge Suſius kepte her faith vnto her huſbande / beyng in captiuite / and ſpended out all her goodis for his lyfe: And whan he was ſlayne in batayle / ſhe dyed voluntarily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hym. The doughter of Iulius Ceſar / whiche was maryed vnto Pompey the great / whan one brought vpon a tyme home out of the feelde a cote of her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des be bloded / ſhe ſuſpecty<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that her huſbande had be wounded / fell to the grounde in ſwonynge / and almoſte deed: with the whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyghte
<pb facs="tcp:181141:86"/>of her mynde / ſhe fell to labour of chylde a fore her tyme / and ſo dyed. Alſo Cornelia / the laſte wyfe of the ſame Pompei / ſayde: Hit was ſhame for a woman / that coude nat dye with only ſorowe whan her huſbande was ſlayne. Arthemiſia / the quene of Lyde / dyd drynke the aſſhes of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / after his deth / bicauſe for very loue ſhe wold haue her owne bodye to be her huſbandes graue. Theſe great thynges haue I reherſed / that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that be nowe a dayes may be aſhamed / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the wyll nat endeuour them ſelfe to perfourme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more eaſye thynges. Wherfore theyr cruelte and wickednes is more intollerable / that can fy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in theyr hartes to ſe theyr huſbandes lye in trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble / damage / and worldly ſhame / and all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorowe that canne be for a ſmall money / whan they haue inoughe in ſtoore to rydde them out of dangere.</p>
               <p>O harte more harder than any beaſt / that canſte ſuffre thy blode / thy body / and thyne owne ſelfe on thy huſbandes parte / to be ſo vexed: Doutles the lawes that ſuffre that iniquite / haue more regard of money than feith or conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But this maner hath bene lefte vs of the pagans / with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / whiche abyde more ſurely in vs / than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe of Chriſte doth alowe: whiche commaundeth vs to lay forth both clothyng / metall / and what trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo ouer we haue in ſtore / nat only the wyfe for her huſbande / but alſo one chriſten man for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / be he neuer ſo vnknowen. Wherfore lette the woman vnderſtande / that if ſhe wyll nat ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de all her ſubſtance to ſaue her huſbande from neuer ſo
<pb facs="tcp:181141:87"/>lytell harmes / ſhe is nat worthy to beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name / neither of a good / nor chriſten woman / nor ones to be called a wyfe: Neither I wold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe ſhulde loue her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / as one loueth his frende / or his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / that is to ſay / I will that ſhe ſhall gyue hym great worſhyp reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / great obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / &amp; ſeruyce alſo: whiche thynge nat only thexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the olde worlde teacheth vs / but alſo all lawes / both ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral / and Nature her ſelfe cryeth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And in all kyndes of beaſtis the fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mals obey y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> malles &amp; wayten vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them / &amp; fawne vpon them / and ſuffre them ſelfe to be corrected of them: whiche thynge Nature ſheweth muſt be / and is conuenient to be done. Whiche as Ariſtotel in his boke of beaſtis ſheweth / hath gyuen leſſe ſtrength and power vnto the femalles of all kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of beaſtis / than to the males / and more ſofte fleſſhe / and tender heare. More ouer / theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes / whiche nature hath gyuen for weapons of de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fence vnto beaſtis / as tethe / hornes / ſpores / and ſuche other / the moſt parte of females lacke / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che theyr males haue / as hartes and bores. And if any females haue any of theſe / yet be they more ſtronger in the males / as hornes of bullis be more ſtronger than of kyne. In all the whiche thinges Nature ſheweth / that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> males dutie is to ſuccour and defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / and the femals to folowe and to wayte vpon the male / and to crepe vnder his ayde / and obeye hym / that ſhe may lyue the better. But let vs leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> examples of beaſtis / whiche make vs
<pb facs="tcp:181141:87"/>aſhamed of our ſelfe without we paſſe them i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue / and lette vs aſcende vp vnto mannes reaſon. Nowe than / what woman wyll be ſo preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſo haute / to diſobey her huſbandes byd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge / if ſhe conſyder that he is vnto her in ſteede of father and mother and all her kynne / and that ſhe oweth vnto hym / all the loue and charite that were due to them all? A ragious and a foliſſhe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth nat conſyder this / the whiche is diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyent vnto her huſbande. Excepte parauenture ſhe wolde ſay / ſhe oweth none obedience / neither to father nor to mother / nor to none of her kynne. For if ſhe obey them / ſhe muſt nedes obey her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: in whom by al rightes / by all cuſtomes / by all ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and lawes / by all preceptes and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes / both naturall / worldely / and heuenly / ſhe oughte to acompte all thyng to be. The woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nat rekened the more worſhipful amonge men / that preſumeth to haue maſtrye aboue her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande: but the more foliſſhe / and the more worthy to be mocked: Yea and more ouer than that curſed and vnhappy: the whiche tourneth backewarde the lawes of nature / lyke as thoughe a ſodioure wolde rule his capitayne / or the moone wold ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de aboue the ſonne / or the arme aboue the heed. For in wedlocke the man reſembleth the reaſon / and the woman the body: Nowe reaſon ought to rule and the body to obey / if a man wyl lyue. Alſo ſaint Paule ſayth: The heed of the woman is the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here nowe I entre in to the diuyne commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / whiche in ſtomackes of reaſonable people / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:88"/>oughte of reaſon to beare more rule and valewe / than lawes / more than all mannes reaſons / and more than the voyce of nature her ſelfe. God the maker of this holle worlde / in the begynnynge whan the worlde was yet but rude and newe / gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge lawes vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kynde / he gaue this charge vnto the woman. Thou ſhalte be vnder thyn huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes rule / and he ſhall haue dominion ouer the. The Apoſtle Paule / teacher of the Chriſten wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome / that is for to ſay / of the heuenly wiſedome / wolde nat haue the woman to rule the man / but commaundeth her in many places to be ſubiecte. Peter alſo / the prince of the apoſtles / commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dethe in this wyſe: Lette all women be ſubiecte to theyr huſbandes / as holy women / truſtynge in our lorde. Sara was obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto Abraham / and called hym her lorde. Saynt Hieronyme wryteth vnto Celantia in this wyſe: Let the auctorite and rule be reſerued vnto thyn huſbande: and be thou an example to all thyne houſe / what ſoueraynetie they owen vnto hym: Do thou proue hym to be lorde by thyn obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / and make hym great with thyne humilite: For the more honour thou gyueſt vnto hym / the more honourable thou ſhalt be thy ſelfe. For as the Apoſtle ſaythe / the heed of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nowe the holle body can no where haue more honour / than of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heed / this ſaith ſaint Hieronyme. But folyſſhe women do nat ſe / howe ſore they diſhoneſte them ſelfe / that take the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raynte of theyr huſbandes: of whom all theyr ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noure muſte come: And ſo in ſekynge for honour / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:88"/>they loſe it: For if the huſbande lacke honour / the wyfe muſt nedes go without it: Neither kynred / ryches / nor welthe can a vayle her. For who wyll gyue any honour to that man / whom he ſeeth ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtred by a woman. And agayne / if thy huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de be honorable / be thou neuer ſo lowe of byrthe / neuer ſo poure / neuer ſo vncomly of face / yet canſte thou nat lacke honour: for neither beautie / kynred / nor ryches made Oreſtilla honorable / after ſhe was ones maried to vngracious Catiline: nor pouerte letted nat Salonia to be honored of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romayns / whiche was wyfe vnto the wyſe Cato. But nowe that thou mayſte better obey thy huſbande / and do all thynges after his mynde / fyrſte thou muſte lerne all his maners / and conſyder well his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and ſtate: For there be many kyndes of huſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bandes / and all ought to be loued / honored / and worſhipped / &amp; obeyed / but all muſt nat be e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treated vnder one maner: For huſbandes muſte be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled / as Terence ſpeketh / after thopinion of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to / ſayeng: Mans lyfe is as it were a game at the tables: For if that chance of the dyce / that is nat for them / hit muſt be amended by crafty playeng: lyke wiſe in huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / if thou haue one after thyn appetite / thou mayſte be glad / and he is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored / &amp; obeyed: but if he be yll / either fynde ſome crafte to make hym good / or at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leaſte wiſe better to deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Nowe thy huſbande ſhall be either for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tunate or infortunate: Fortune I calle them that haue goodnes either of mynde or of body / or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: Infortunate I call thoſe / that lacke any of

Nor let them nat loue goodly men for theyr beautie / nor riche men for theyr mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney / nor men of great auctorite for theyr honoure: for if they do ſo / than ſhall they hate the ſekely / the poure / and thoſe that beare no rule. If thou haue a lerned huſbande / lerne good holy leſſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of hym: if he be vertuous / do after hym: but if he be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate / cal vnto reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce the ſayeng of Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius the great / a verye noble and a wyſe man / whiche whan he was ouer comen of Iulius Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar / and came vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ile of Leſbo to receyue his wyfe / and flee away with her / ſhe ſeynge her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande beaten and ouercomen / fell vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grounde halffe deed for ſorowe / to ſe her huſbande haue ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a fall: whom Pompeius lyftyng vp in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes from the grounde / and reuied agayne / ſpake vnto her in this maner: My dere wyfe Cornelia / moſte ſwete vnto me of all thynges / I wonder of the ſo noble a woman to be ouer commen in ſuche maner at the fyrſte ſtroke of Fortune: nowe thou haſt an occaſion to optayne immortall honore: For as for eloquence / or lernyng in the lawe / or feattes of warre are no matters for women to wynne wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhippe

Clare the wyfe of Barnarde Valdaure / a fayre and a goodly mayde / whan ſhe was fyrſte maryed at Bruges / and brought to bed vnto her huſbande / whiche was .xlvi. yere of age / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſte nyght ſawe his legges rolled and wrapped with cloutes / and founde that ſhe hadde chaunſed on a ſore and a ſekely huſbande: yet for all that / ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed hym neuer the more / nor begane nat to hate hym / whom yet ſhe had no ſpace to loue.

And her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; goſſyppis ſayde: it was ſynfully done / to vexe the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the worlde / or kepe him lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger on lyue with his ſickenes / &amp; bad her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide ſome good thyng for the ſoule / as for the body care no more / but howe it myght be buryed: with whiche ſayeng ſhe was neuer a whytte abaſſhed / but very dilygently procured bothe ſuche as was for the welthe of his ſoule / and prepared holſome meates for his body: and gaue great intendaunce about hym / ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gyng his ſhetes / &amp; his clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes / bycauſe he hadde an excedyng laxe / and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / and fylthe ranne out of dyuers partes of his body: Wherewith ſhe was ſo buſyed / that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte parte of the day ſhe neuer reſted / but ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne vp and downe all the daye longe. So at the laſte by the good meanes of his wyfe / Valdaure eſcaped the great ieoperdye / that bothe the phiſitions / and all other men ſwered / his wyfe hadde plucked hym from deth by ſtronge hande. And ſome teſted more merily than becommeth chriſten folkes / and ſaid / that god had purpoſed to haue ſlayne Valdaure / but his wyfe wolde nat let hym go out of her han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. After that / by the reaſon of an hote humour rennynge from his heed / the gryſtle within his noſe beganne for to canker: Wherfore the phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had gyuen hym a pouder / whiche muſte be blowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in with a penne or a rede in to his noſe / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſeruice whan euery man abhorred / bycauſe of the tedious ſauour / his wyfe refuſed nat to do hit. Alſo within a whyle his chekes &amp; his chy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne brake
<pb facs="tcp:181141:93"/>out of ſcabbes / wheales / and of ſkales / that no barbour / neither well coude / nor gladly wolde ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue hym: than his wyfe with a payre of ſcyſſours / founde the meanes to clippe his berde wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous properly. Streight after he fell in to an other lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge diſeaſe / whiche laſted nere .vij. yere: where ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beyng weary / with contynuall dilygence and labour about hym / prepared his meate / and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day dyd ſalue and bynde his ſore and ſtynkyng legges and rounnyng of matter ſo hanſomly / that thou woldeſt ſay / if thou haddeſt ſene her / that ſhe had ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled muſke / and nat ſuche ſtynky<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g geare.

Moreouer / whan there was required great coſte daylye in the houſe / to helpe and noriſſhe the man opreſſed with ſo many ſickeneſſes / nor hadde neyther rentes nor other profittis commynge in / ſhe ſpoyled her ſelfe of all her rynges / chaynis / bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches / and clothes leſt he ſhulde lacke ought dury<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his ſickenes: ſhe was content as for her ſelfe with any fare / ſo that her huſbande myght haue that ſhulde do his paynful body good / ſo he by the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of his wyfe / with that dolefull body / more like

Wherby a man may clerely perceyue / howe moche theyr holynes and vertue is worthe / that loue theyr huſbandes with all their hartes as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is / whiche doubtles god wyll neuer leaue vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. So at the laſt this forſaid man died ſicke and olde / and paſſed out of his contynuall payne. For whoſe departynge this ſame Clara his wyfe made ſuche ſorowe / that all that euer knewe her / ſaye / they neuer ſawe woman make ſuche ſorowe for her huſbande / that were bothe yonge / holle / fayre / luſty / and ryche: and whan dyuerſe came to her / nat for to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte her / but rather to ſhewe her / that they were glad for her ſake / that he was gon ſhe abhorted / and in a maner curſed them for their laboure / wyſſhynge many tymes that ſhe myght haue hym agayne if it were poſſyble / howe ſo euer he were / and whan ſhe was of luſty age / after his deth / yet ſhe wolde neuer mary / ſayeng: ſhe ſhulde neuer mete with any that ſhe coulde lyke ſo well / I wyll nat reherſe here her great chaſtite &amp; holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of lyuyng. For I ſpeke but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of a good wyfe: whiche neuer lyghtly gothe alone / but euer coupled / &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyed with all other vertues. Who ſeeth nat nowe that ſhe dyd nat marie Valdaures
<pb facs="tcp:181141:94"/>bodye / but his harte / or els rekened his bodye her owne body? Beſyde that / ſhe kepeth ſtyll all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of her huſbande / as reuerentlye as he were yet a lyue / and doth many thynges as ſhe had harde hym ſpeake in his lyfe / ſayeng / this myne huſbande wolde haue commanded and byd den do. O Euryppides / if thou haddeſt had ſuche a wyfe / thou woldeſt haue preyſed all women as faſte as thou haſte diſpreyſed them. Or if kynge Agamemnon had hadde ſuche a quene / ſhe wolde haue taryed many yeres for his retournyng from the ſige of Troy. Theſe examples ought nat to be kept vnſhewed / to remembre wyues of their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye / ſeynge that leſſe matters be put in memorye &amp; writynge. But theſe be but of folkes of lowe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre / wyll ſome gentle women ſaye. Fyrſte to make anſwere therto: Clara Valdaure was nat of the loweſte degre / and beſyde that yonge / and tender / and fayre / and had many ſeruauntes / vnto whom ſhe myght haue deputed all her buſynes / if it had pleaſed her. And there be many noble wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that do the ſame / whom I canne nat reherſe all / bothe nowe a lyue and that hath bene in tymes paſte. But this worlde of ours kepeth in vſe only the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the olde worldes afore. Arte thou more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the wyfe of Themiſtocles / whiche was prince of Athenes / and alſo of all Grece: and yet ſhe ſerued her huſbande her ſelfe alway in his ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes? Arte thou more noble thanne Stratonica / wyfe vnto kynge Deiotarus / whiche whan her huſbande was ſicke / and an aged man / was both

All the noble women of Rome / vſed nor wold neuer ſuffer any other to touche theyr huſbandes whan they were ſicke / but them ſelfe: whoſe examples there is none nowe a dayes to good to take hede of. For anſwere me thou woman / that thinkeſt the better than the Romayns / of whoſe bloode who ſo euer was diſcended / was had in honoure throughe all the worlde: howe be it the verye nobylite is nat to be counted by blode and riches / the whiche rather ſtandeth in noble actis and vertue: and thou with all thy gentrye ſhall lye vnknowen: whan all the worlde perpetually ſhall talke of them. Therfore boſt nat thou thy noble byrthe / whom either none orels very fewe ſhall knowe / either in thy lyfe or af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter thy dethe. But parauenture thou woldeſt ſay / I brought goodes &amp; money moughe to make me noble with. O thou fylthy and beaſtylly woman / that weneſte thy ſelfe to be a wyfe / bycauſe thou haſte a man lyenge by thy ſyde / weneſte thou that wedlocke ſtandeth in that? Thou breakeſt the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of god and Nature. For if thou woldeſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the thyne owne body / beynge diſeaſed / and loke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thy ſores and handle them / thou oughteſt nat to refuſe to do the ſame vnto thyn huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / ſeyng that ye be bothe as one perſon. Therfore where is that ſame inſeperate mate / whiche thou preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt / if thou ſterte from hym / whan thou ſhuldeſt abyde moſt nere? Wherfore vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / that thou

Wherfore if thou be aſhamed of that / thou mayſt lyke wyſe be aſhamed of that thou doſt vnto thy huſbande: Whom thou oughteſt to regarde more than them all. And many leaue theyr mothers lyenge ſicke / nor loue any bodye but them ſelfes / whiche were worthy to be loued of no body els / and no more be they in dede. Howe often haue we ſene beſtis with out reaſon / ruled only by nature / one cheriſhe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / and the femall lycke the ſores of the male / as kyene / and dogges / lyons / beares / and all other bothe wylde and came?

Nowe to ſhewe furder of my matter / if thy huſbande were yll / yet ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou to ſuffce hym / nor ſtryue with hym / by ſhrewdenes / leſte thou neuer haue ende of ſorowe and myſchefe: but whan he is more pacified / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gyue hym warnynge by curteſe and gentyll mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to amende his lyuyng. And if he wyll do after thy ſayeng / than ſhalte thou proffitte bothe hym and thy ſelfe: but if he begynne to waxe angrye / ſtryue nat with hym / thou haſt done thy duetye:
<pb facs="tcp:181141:95"/>Therfore let hym along and ſuffre hym / and thou ſhalte haue nat onely great commendation afore men / but alſo great merite afore god.

And many do bicauſe of their promiſe / thynges whiche els they wolde nat. Therfore gyue thy dilygence bothe to ſeme to do / and to do in dede / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche thou muſte nedes do / be thou neuer ſo lothe: &amp; ſo ſhall all thoſe thynges be lyght and pleaſant vnto the: whiche if thou be lothe to do / hit ſhall be greuous &amp; payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Nowe I perceyue that ſomme put doubtes / howe farre they ought to obey theyr huſbandes: verely in all thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be either honeſt / or without vice / there is no doubte but a woman ought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beye her huſbandes commandement / as a diuine lawe. For the huſbande beareth the roume of god here in erthe vnto his wyfe / and preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Therfore if there be any thyng / that the wyfe wolde gyue vnto god / ſhe neyther ought nor maye do hit without her huſbandes lycence. For what maye a woman reken to be more her owne / than her body and mynde? And yet ſayth ſaynt Paule / that the woman hath no power of her owne body / neither ſhe can nat a vowe chaſtite vnto god / her huſbande either nat wyllynge / or nat knowynge. Wherfore if thyn huſbande wolde haue the other wyſe occupied / thou mayſt nat only nat go forth to dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or ſe playes / or go to feaſtis / and paſſe tyme
<pb facs="tcp:181141:96"/>with goſſyppes / whiche be poyntes of common harlottes: but thou mayſte nat as moche as go pray or walke about to churches / without his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue: or elles be thou ſure / that neyther thy prayer is pleaſaunte vnto god / nor thou ſhalte nat fynde god in the churche. God wolde that thou pray and go to the churche / but that is / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt done thyne huſbandes buſynes at home / and he hath none other labour to ſette the about. And theſe be the poyntes of wedlocke / whiche god lyketh beſte in a maried woman. For in his goſpel / he byddeth a man be at one with his frende / or he come nere his aulter: howe moche more than / wold he haue the to be at one with thyn huſbande / whiche farre paſſeth any frende? Wherto goſte thou to maſſe or churches / whan thyne huſbande commaundeth other wyſe / eyther by wordes expreſſedlye / or by countinaunce preueyly? Weneſt thou to fynde god in the churche whan thou leaueſt thyne huſbade at home either ſicke or hungry? Thou mayſt fy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de all halowes about his bedde / bothe aulters / god / peace / concorde / and charite / and ſpecially where the man and wyfe be coupled with theſe thynges. Thou ſhalt ſone make god thy fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / if thou make thyne huſbande thy frende afore. God nedeth nat moche of our ſeruice. But vertuous lyuynge / and high honour / them he reſerueth vnto hym ſelfe / o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges to be kepte in the worlde / as loue and concorde.

<pb facs="tcp:181141:97"/>vnto folkes in this worlde: and caſteth out from the inheritaunce of heuen / that hath ben enuious and malytious agaynſt theyr euen chriſten. For thou ſhalte eaſily make god thy frende / if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile thyne euen Chriſten vnto the before. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is any way more redye vnto goddes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour / than fyrſte to optayne fauour of thyne euen Chriſten. Therfore let a woman thynke that ſhe dothe a great ſacrifyce / whan ſhe ſerueth her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande: and thinke that ſhe viſetteth churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly / if ſhe be diligent about her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des bed. But there be ſome women / that if their huſbande were neuer ſo ſicke / yet wolde they neuer let theyr walkyng of their ſtations to churches about / and that more for theyr pleaſure / than deuotion to god warde. But where to ſhulde we talke of them? Saynt Paule wrytyng vnto Tymothe ſpeaketh of womannes duete in this wyſe: Let the woman lerne with all obedyence / kepynge ſylence. For I wyll nat haue the woman to be a teacher / nor to rule her huſbande / but kepe ſylence. Alſo writyng vnto the Corinthies / he ſaythe: Lette your wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men nat ſpeake in the churche / but if they lyſte lerne ought / that they be in doubte of / aſke theyr huſbandes at home. Whiche lawe in myne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on meaneth none other thynge / but that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to lerne of her huſbande / and in ſuch thynges as ſhe ſtandeth in doute of / to folowe his mynde / and beleue as he doth: and if the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de do wronge / hym ſelfe ſhall beare all the blame / the wyfe ſhalbe out of faute: excepte it be ſo manifeſt
<pb facs="tcp:181141:97"/>that ſhe maye perceyue the faute her ſelfe playnly mough / or els be taught other wiſe of ſuche as the huſbande hym ſelfe myght well inoughe lerne.</p>
               <p>For thoſe thynges that be agaynſte the lawes of god / ſhe ought nat to do though her huſbande co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de her neuer ſo moche. For ſhe muſte a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege one for better than her huſbande and haue more in price / that is Chriſte. The man is heed of the woman / but Chriſte is heed of the man. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holy women of our fayth haue bene ſore puniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of theyr huſbandes / for folowynge Chriſt is preceptes agaynſt theyr wyll. And yet the apoſtle Paule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde that he wyfe nat to departe from her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de without his leaue / be he neuer ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious. So great be the bondes of wedlocke / that the Chriſten myght nat departe from the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then without leaue. What than ought we to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe / where bothe be Chriſtened / and bothe good? Ariſtotel ſayth: A good woman ought to take the maners of her huſbande / as a lawe and rule of her lyuynge / gyuen her by god by the couplynge of matrimony. And hit becommeth her to accorde with her huſbande and ſerue hym / nat onely in proſperite / but alſo in aduerſite. If he lacke good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es / or be ſicke of his body / or out of his mynde / let her ſuffre and obey hym / excepte it be ſome vnclen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly thynge / or vncommelye. Nor let her nat beare longe in mynde / if her huſbande offende her / by reaſon of diſtreſſe of his mynde: but lay the cauſe in his diſeaſe and ignorance. For the more pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe vſeth him in theſe poyntes / the more thanke
<pb facs="tcp:181141:98"/>ſhall he gyue her / whanne he is amended. And if there be any vncommely thynge commanded her by hym / whiche ſhe hath nat done / he ſhall conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre that better after his amendynge. Wherfore a woman ought to abſteyne from yll / but in all good thynges / to obeye none other wyſe / than thoughe ſhe had ben bought in to the houſe as a bonde and hande mayde. And in dede ſhe is boughte with a great price / that is to ſay feloſhip of lyfe / and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / whiche / nothy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g can be greatter nor holyer. Moreouer if ſhe had had a welthy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande / than coude nat her goodnes bene ſo moche knowen. For hit is but a ſmall acte to handle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperite well. Howe be it to ſuffre aduerſite pacient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is counted a great thynge. For in great aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and harmes nat to be in extreme diſpayre / is a poynte of a noble ſtomacke. Therfore ſhe hadde nede to praye / that no harme bechaunce her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. But if any aduerſite fall / than let her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidre / that ſhe ſhall wynne great worſhip there by / if ſhe behaue her ſelfe well. And let her remembre / that neither quene Alceſt ſhulde haue had ſo great honoure / nor quene Penolepe ſo great prayſe / if they had lyued in proſperite with their huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. For by the aduerſite of kyng Admetus and Vlyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes cauſed them eternall memory.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer / bycauſe I haue purpoſed to make a ſeuerall boke of her actis and her lyfe. And many women that loue indiſcretelye breake concorde at ones. Therfore muſte theyr diſcreſſyon be holpen forthe with ſome teachynge / and theyr ferſenes abated. And that with this one thyng / if they ſtaye theyr mynde and fantaſyes / whiche ſone caryeth the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byll reaſon of women away with them. Therfore a woman ſhulde haue great demurenes and ſober<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes in her mynde / and ſhewe hit with her dedes. And often I warne her / that ſhe do nothynge for to ſeme and for a countenance: For that is a thyng of ſmal value or none. But as ſhe wolde ſeme to be ſuche / let her be in dede: and than ſhall ſhe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more truely appere. Let her wene neuer to diſceyue any body by clokynge and diſſymulation. For men be
<pb facs="tcp:181141:101"/>nat ſuche ſtockes nor ſtoones / that they canne nat knowe a counterfeted thing from a thyng in dede. And thoughe they diſceyue folkes that loke vpon them / yet canne they nat diſceyue nature / whiche hath nat gyuen lyke vertue vnto thinges counter feted as true in dede. Lette them make proffe in them ſelfe.

Hit were good for a wyfe to vſe that counſayle / that Horace the wyſe poet gyueth vnto Lollius / howe to vſe his frende / vyddyng hym applye hym ſelfe vnto his frendes appetyte. If he lyſte hunte ſayth he / do thou nat ſyt to make verſys / but caſt vp thy muſes / and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the herſes caryeng the nettes / &amp; leade forthe dogges.

And Cecilius Plinius ſheweth in many piſtelles
<pb facs="tcp:181141:101"/>that he loued his wyfe moſte derely / in whiche pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolles ther is one writen vnto Hiſpula his wyues awnt / whiche had brought her vp / where he gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth her great tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes / that ſhe ſo taught her and brought vp / whan ſhe was a chylde: and alſo ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the cauſe why he loued his wyfe ſo well / wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of his wyfe in this wyſe: She loueth me / whiche is a ſygne of chaſtite. And more ouer ſhe is greatly gyuen vnto lernyng whiche fantaſy ſhe hath taken by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue ſhe hath vnto me. She hath my bokes / and redeth / and lerneth them without boke: &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſo euer I ſhall pleade / ſhe is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders carefull: and whan I haue done merueylous ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. She ſettes folkes to watche / howe I am ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the people / what countenaunce / what noyſe I cauſe them to make / what iudgement I get in the ende.

She ſyngeth my verſes / and playeth them on the lute. None other maiſter teacheth her / but the loue ſhe hath vnto me / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is the beſt ſchole maiſter of all. This wryteth Plinius. A late wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was at Paris and talked with Guilielmus Budeus at his owne hous / and his wyfe come bye / where as we walked / a goodly perſonne and a fayre / as a man ſhulde loke vpon / whiche as I coude deme by her comly maner and countenance / me thought ſhulde be both a prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and vertuous huſwyfe. So ſhe after ſhe hadde ſalued her huſbande / with ſuche reuerence as a

In whiche thyng me thynke her worthy more preyſe than was Plinius wyfe: in as moche as ſhe was lerned her ſelfe / and this is nat. Nowe howe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che more honeſtly dothe ſhe / than ſuche as drawe theyr huſbandes from ſtudy / and counſayle them to luker / playe / or other pleaſures / that they may obtayne parte them ſelfe / either of luker / playe / or volupties / bycauſe they can get no parte of theyr ſtudy. And the foles knowe nat howe moche more ſure and veraye pleaſure hit were / to haue a wyſe man than a ryche or voluptuous. Moreouer they ſhulde lyue a great deale more quietlye with wyfe men than with ignorant foles / that neuer had ſet the brydell of reaſon to rule theyr fantaſyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al / whiche be for the more parte caried quite away with ſuche motions as comme in theyr myndes. Nor ſhe ſhulde loth in her huſbande neither ſtudy nor any thing els / either by wordes / countenance / or geſture / or any maner of ſygnes: ſhe ſhall loue all thynge in hym / haue all thynge in reuerence / and ſet great ſtore by it / what ſo euer he dothe / aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent all thyng vnto hym / and beleue what ſo ener he ſayth / though he tolde that neither were true / nor lyke to be / nor preſume aboue her huſbande in any maner thyng ſhe ſhall reken hym her father / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:102"/>her lorde / her elder / her better. This ſhal ſhe both knowlege in dede / and make ſemblaunce of. For howe can any loue or frendſhip ſtande / if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge ryche diſpiſe hym poure: or fayre thy ſelfe / loth hym beyng foule: or thy ſelfe of great bloode / diſdayne hym as of lowe byrthe? Iuuenall ſaith / there is nothynge more intollerable than a ryche wyfe. Saynt Hieronyme ſaith the ſame / writing agaynſt Iouyntane. And Theophraſt ſayth / it is a turment to ſuffre a ryche wyfe: but I canne nat beleue that / excepte they ſay / if ſhe be ill and lewde with all. For what a lewdenes is hit / nat to conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der howe vayne a thyng that money is? for hit is the vyleſt of all thyng that men be proude of. But many lyghte and frayle myndes wyll ryſe a lofte with a lyttell wynde. Ah foole / doth nat wedlocke make all thynge commen? For if that frendſhipe make all thyng commen / howe moche more dothe maryage make commen nat onely theyr money / but alſo frendes / kynſfolke and all thynges elles? Wherfore the Rhomayns as Plutarche ſaythe / commaunded in theyr lawes / that the huſbande and wyfe ſhulde gyue nothyng one vnto a nother / bycauſe that neither ſhulde reken any thynge pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly theyr owne. In a good commen wele Plato ſayth / that theſe wordes / myne and thyne / ſhulde be put awaye. Than moche more in a good houſe holde / whiche is than the beſte &amp; moſt perfet / ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to moſte welthfull / whan there is as one body vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one heed. For if it haue many heddes or many bodyes / hit is lyke a monſter. Moreouer all the
<pb facs="tcp:181141:103"/>huſbandes and after the ſimilitude of Plutarch / though there be more water tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cuppe / yet is all the myxture called wyne / ſo thoughe the woman brynge neuer ſo moche with her / and the man neuer ſo lytell / yet all is his. For he muſte ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des haue all that the woman hath / that hath her ſelfe &amp; is her lorde. And y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> mayſt here our lorde ſay to the: Woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou ſhalte be in the rule of thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande: and he ſhall haue the maiſtre on the. Nor he is to be diſpiſed for his fauoure. For thou haſte fauour / &amp; he hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> / with thy fauour. I wyll nat diſpute / howe ſklender a thing beautte is / whiche ſtandeth but onely in mennes opynyons. For ſhe that is fayre in one mannes ſight / is foule in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Howe frayle / and vnto howe many ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies indangered / howe fletynge / and howe vnſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thyng is beautie / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one agewe / one wart / or one heare maye of the mooſte goodly make the moſte lothſome? And in men no body deſyreth ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che grace of fayrnes: but they thynke in a woman very comely: and yet ſhalte thou rede in the wyſe kynges ſayeng: fauour is a diſceitfull thyng / and beautie is vayne: But the woman that dredeth god / ſhe ſhalbe preyſed. Fynally / ſeynge that ye be one fleſhe / or rather one perſon bothe thou and thy huſbande / than can he neuer be foule that hath a fayre wyfe. And if thou wylte nat ſuppoſe neither the wyfe nor the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to be fayre / vertue alone is both beautie &amp; noblenes. I wyll let paſſe here / howe foliſſhe a thynge hit is / that they call noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Whoſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and eſtimation ſtandeth in the
<pb facs="tcp:181141:103"/>comen voyce of people / whiche is maiſter of all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. But be thou neuer ſo noble / if thou marye to one vnnoble / thou arte made vnnobler than he: nor the wyfe can nat be more noble than her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. For that thynge canne nat be alowed in no kynde of beaſtis. The chyldren haue the name of the father thorowe all the worlde / as of the better: and than if thou be very noble / either muſte he be made very noble / or thou vnnoble. And in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile lawe the women haue theyr dignite of theyr huſbandes / and nat of theyr fathers / in ſo moche that thoſe that were commyn of mooſte noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / if they maryed vnto one of lowe degree / they were nat called noble. And that appered well in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble women of Rome / whiche droue out of the chapell of chaſtite / that was ordayned for noble women / one Virginia / commen of noble pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / bicauſe ſhe was maryed vnto a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of lowe byrth: &amp; therfore they ſayde ſhe was none of them / but of the comen rate of people: neither ſhe denyed that / nor was aſhamed to be taken for one of the lowe people / nor diſpiſed the commen people in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the noblys / nor abaſhed to be called Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nius wyfe. Alſo Cornelia / doughter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scipio / whan ſhe was maryed vnto an houſe / whiche was in dede great and famous / and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: Howe be it / nothynge able to be compared with her fathers / beyng her ſelfe of the beſt bloode in Rome / and one the mooſte chefe of that bloode / doughter of Scipio: whiche was the conquerour of Affrike / the prince of the Senate / and all the
<pb facs="tcp:181141:104"/>people of Rome / and alſo of all the worlde moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent / though ſhe hadde to her mother Emylia / comen of the blode of the Emylians / the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and famous / bothe in Rome / and all the worlde: yet ſhe hauynge ſo great honour bothe of fathers ſyde and of mothers / had leauer euer be called Cornelia Gracchi / by her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des name / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cornelia Scipionis. Wherfore ſome were diſcontent / whiche for honour vſed to cal her Cornelia Scipionis / by her fathers name. Theſia / ſiſter vnto the elder Dioniſius the tyrant of Syracuſe / was maried to one Philoxenus / whiche wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had gone about to do a diſpleaſure vnto Dioniſius / and whan he was ſpyed was conſtrayned to fie out of Sycille / this Theſia his wyfe was ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for by the kynge her brother / and rebuked of hym / bycauſe ſhe dyd nat diſcouer her huſbandes flyghte vnto hym. Whye ſayde ſhe / weneſt thou that I were ſo vile and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte / that if I hadde knowen of his goynge / I wolde nat a gone with all and folowed hym / and bene rather the wyfe of Philoxenus the out lawe in any place in the worlde / than kynge Dioniſius ſyſter here at home in my countrey: And all the Siracuſyans hadde in great reuerence this gaye and vertuous mynde of hers. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were banyſhed / they bothe worſhipped her in her lyfe / and honoured after her deth. Mary the wyfe of Maximilian the emperour / whiche had by her father of inheritance all Flanders and Pycatdye / and the people ſet nought by the ſymple and ſofte diſpoſition of Maximilian / and ſewed for all theyr
<pb facs="tcp:181141:104"/>matters vnto Mary his wyfe / yet wolde ſhe neuer determyne nothy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g without her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des aduiſe / whoſe will ſhe rekened euer for a lawe / though ſhe myght well inough haue ruled and ordened all as ſhe lyſt / w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his good wyll: whiche vſed to ſuffer of his mylde ſtomacke any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe lyſt / vnto his good and prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wyfe / &amp; that in her owne goodes. So Mary by obeynge her huſbande / and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng hym ſo well / brought hym in to great aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite / and made the people more obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto them both / as though their powers were increaſed and ayded either by other. And theſe dueties be in the mynde. Nowe muſt we brydell the tonge / whiche if the mynde be well brydeled it ſhall rule it well i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. For the cauſe why many women be catle of tonge is bicauſe they can nat rule their my<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. For ire occupieth them holle / and plucketh out of ſcaam / nor ſuffreth any pte of them to rule it ſelfe: and therfore haue they neyther meaſure nor reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their chydyng and ſcolding. For they be put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde all reaſon and diſcretion / whan the fyre hath catched all to gether and made his owne: whiche ſoone increaſeth in ſofte tymber and apte for fyre: Wherof commeth ragyng / bothe of ſtomacke and tonge without meaſure. Whiche I haue ofte wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred on and that in very good and honeſt women / in whom ſauyng this one vice / there lacketh nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chaſtite nor goodnes manyfolde &amp; great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Yet haue I myſſed in them moderation and temperaunce of ire &amp; language: in ſo moche that I haue ben aſhamed of it / though none of it hath
<pb facs="tcp:181141:105"/>pertayned to me / but bene amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge thoſe that haue bene very ſtrangers to me / at leaſt if one Chriſten body ought to be a ſtranger vnto an other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is a harde vertue for a woman to temper her tonge / ſo verily hit is the moſte goodly vertue that can be longe to any. Whiche thynge ſhe ſhall eaſly do / if ſhe abyde in her owne power / nor ſuffer her ſelfe to be caried away with her owne fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſies / as it were with ſtormes of wether. And this lette her ofte call to mynde ſpecially / and purpoſe while ſhe is ſafe &amp; in her owne power / that if ſhe chaunce to falle at wordes with her huſbande / ſhe rebuke nat nor diſpreyſe either his kynne / or perſon / or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / or his lyfe / whiche thing ſhe woteth ſhulde greue his ſtomacke. For if he be angred / with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a thynge / he wyll bothe be worſe to reconſyle / and after that he is agreed agayne / yet as ofte as that worde commeth vnto his remembraunce / he wyll neuer loke merily on her / beſyde the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that it is to god. For our lorde ſayth in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Mattheu: who ſo ſaythe vnto his brother <hi>Racha</hi> / that is to ſaye / braynles / ſhalbe accuſable vnto the counſaile: and he that ſayth fole / ſhall be dampnable vnto the pyt of fyre. Nowe than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyder what thou ſhalte haue / that makeſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great raylyng / nat onely on thy brother / but alſo thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / and as moche as lyeth in the / on the deputy of god and all thy kyn. And if thy huſbande laye any ſuche thyng vnto thy charge / be wyſe / that it abyde nat in thy remembraunce / but ſuffre it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently: and whan he is commen vnto hym ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:181141:105"/>agayne / thou ſhalte optayne great thanke of hym for thy ſufferaunce / and ſhalte tourne his furious mynde vnto good: and ſhalte haue hym the more gentyll afterwarde and eaſyer to deale with. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence / whoſe purpoſe was none other / but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the conditions of the worlde in his comedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es / writeth of a chaſt and honeſt yonge woman in this wyfe: She as becometh an honeſte woman / ſhamfaſt / ſad / and demure / ſuffred all the iniures and fautes of her huſbande / and kept cloſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſures. And for theſe cauſes / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des my<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de tourned agayne vnto his wyfe / from whoſe loue he abhorred. And that was the counſayle of the wyfe nurce in Seneke the poet / whiche ſhe gaue vnto Octauia the wyfe of Nero / ſayenge: Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhe thy cruell huſbande rather with obedye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Nor let nat a woman caſt in her huſbandes tethe any benyfyte done vnto hym by her / whiche is an vnſyttyng and a diſpleaſant thynge / yea amonge thoſe that be nothynge a kynne to gether: and he that caſteth his benifyte in an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes tethe / loſeth his thanks that he ſhulde haue had. For he hath ſtryken hit out of the others haſte. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer if thou conſyder well / there can be no benifyte done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> to thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / to whom thou arte bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Nor any good woman wyll make moche reherſall of her kynred or gooddis / whiche thing will light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wery her huſbande beynge neuer ſo louynge. The poet Iuuenal ſayth / that he had leauer haue a poure woman and of lowe byrth / than Cornelia
<pb facs="tcp:181141:106"/>the doughter of Scipio Affrican / (of whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues we haue ſpoken here before) if ſhe be proude and ſtately of her fathers noblenes: For he ſayth in this wyſe:</p>

For as the noble prince was wonte to ſay / a wyfe was a name of dignite and nat of bodily luſt: ſo the huſbande is a name of couplyng and affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / as I haue declared. Nor the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des ought

Howe be it / it is nat conuenient for them to be maiſters of wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes and lechery vnto theyr wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. And let them euer remembre this ſayenge of Xyſtus the philoſopher: He is an adulterar with his wyfe / who ſo is ouer excedyng and ouer hote a louer. And let him obey the apoſtle Paule / ſayeng vnto huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / that they ſhulde haue their wyfe as veſſels of generation in holynes / and nat in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefull concupiſcence or immoderate / as the paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do / that knowe nat god. The ſpouſe in the canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles calleth his ſpouſe ſyſter / to thentent to make his loue more meaſurable: but we wyll returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne vnto women.

For the chaſt woman neuer prouoked the luſt of her huſbande / nor vſed the bodylye pleaſure / but for her huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des pleaſure. Trebellius Pollio wrytethe / that zenobia the quene of Palmyra / a very well lerned and a wyſe woman / was of ſo great chaſtite / that ſhe wolde nat lye with her huſbande / without ſhe had proued before / whether ſhe were with chylde or no. For whan ſhe had lyen with hym ſhe wolde tarye her tyme / to ſe whether ſhe had conceyued: and if ſhe had nat / than was ſhe content to ſuffre her huſbandes wyll agayne. Who wolde thynke / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:109"/>that this woman had any luſte or pleaſure in her body? This was a woman worthy to be had in ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour and reuerence / whiche had no more pleaſure in her naturall partes / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in her fote or her fy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. She had bene worthy to haue borne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with outen mannes company / whiche neuer deſyred it / but only for children: or els to haue brought them forthe without payne / whiche gate them without pleaſure. But one of our chriſten women called E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelffryda / a quene of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / dyd a greatt acte / whiche after ſhe had borne one childe / neuer laye more with her huſbande.

What wordes ſo euer they expounde hit with / ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely hit is a ſore vexation and agony / and a veraye cruell tyranne / whiche as longe as it rayneth and raygeth in the huſbandes harte / let the wyfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hope to haue peaſe. Hit were better for them both to be deade / than any of them to fall in to ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſye / but ſpecially the man. What paynes or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be comparedde: bothe for hym that is vexed with the inquietnes of ieoloſye / and hym / of
<pb facs="tcp:181141:110"/>whom the feare is? Therof ryſeth gronyng / com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnynge / cryenge / with hate bothe of hym ſelfe and other / and perpetuall ſuſpection of harme / &amp; chidyng / braulyng / fyghtyng / yea &amp; alſo murder. For we haue both red and harde tell of many / that haue ſlayne theyr wyues / moued only with ieolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy: the whiche affection doth alſo rage wylde bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis. For Ariſtotle writeth / that the lyon wyll all to teare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyones / if he take her in aduoutry. And I my ſelfe / with many other moo / haue ſeen the Cocke ſwanne kyll his henne / bycauſe ſhe folowed an other cocke. Therfore lette the woman laboure with all her power / leſte this fantaſies come vpon her huſbande / or if it come vpon hym / to get hym out of it / and cauſe hym to leaue it. And that ſhall ſhe do onely by one meanes / that is / if ſhe neyther ſay nor do / that her huſbande may take ſuſpecion of. Saint Paule / ſaint Hieronyme / Ariſtotle / and many other great and wyſe men counſayle verye well / that folkes neither do ill / nor any thyng that longeth to ill. Parauenture thou wylte ſaye / that this is an harde thynge. For who can rule other mennes ſuſpeciouſnes. Yes / many wayes. Fyrſte if thou lyue chaſtly / and that is the redyeſt waye. For tyme euer bryngeth forthe the trouthe / and tyme cauſeth the falſe hode to fade and vanyſſhe away / and confermeth and ſtrentheth the trouth. If thou be good / and haue a ieolious huſbande / yet mayſt thou hope that he wyll put awaye that vnquietnes of mynde. But and thou be noughte / be ſure that that fantaſy ſhal neuer go from hym / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:110"/>but rather increaſe dayly. Fynally / if thou ſuffre thy huſbandes ieoloſy gyltles / thou arte happye / if gylty / thou arte vnhappy. Therfore ſhalt thou both loue thyn huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / and laboure that he may perceyue hym ſelfe loued: but beware that thou vſe no faynynge nor diſſymulation: For than the more craftely that he ſeeth the diſſemble / the more ſore wyll he hate the. For faynynge neuer lyghtlye commeth to the poynt that it is purpoſed: but for the more parte clene contrary. I gyue women of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warnyng / and ofte in dede they nede warnyng / and moche more the men / that they diſceyue nat them ſelfe / ſuppoſynge to be no force / whether one do a thyng in dede or ſome to do it. For they be but foles and ignorante / that wene they ſhall alter the nature of thynges with colorynge and faynynge. Let her ſhewe her ſelfe nat onely to loue no man ſo well as her huſbande / but alſo to loue none other at all but hym. If ſhe loue any other / let it be but for her huſbandes ſake: or if ſhe can nat loue her huſbandes fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / yet let her nat hate them. For there be many men that can be well content / and there to very gladde / to haue all other thynges / in comon with their wyues / excepte frendes. And in the ſame mynde be wyues to / as concernyng their maydes / and other women / that they loue. Whan ſhe is forthe a brode / let her vſe great demurenes / neither loue gladly to kepe company / or common with other womens huſbandes / neither with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that haue a noughtye name / neyther abyde the ſyght of any baude: as for letters / let her nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Theſe muſt I nedes ſaye / bycauſe that I wolde ſhe ſhulde nat onely eſchewe harme / but alſo euery thynge that beareth the colour of harme. Nowe wyll I ſpeke of the womans ieoloſye / whiche if ſhe haue any / I wyll nat greatlye go about moche remedye / to get it away / ſo hit be nat to moche and to violent / and trouble peace of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe / and vexe her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. For if it were ſuche / than hit were good for to ſeke remedy. Fyrſte and formoſt let the woman conſyder / that her huſbande is her lorde / nor that ſhe may do by ryght all that he may. For the man is nat ſo moche bounde as the woman to kepe cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtite / at leaſte wayes by the lawes of the worlde / for by god is lawe both be bounde in lyke. Let her conſidre that the man lyueth more at libertie than the woman / &amp; hath more to care fore. For ſhe hath nothynge to ſe to but her honeſtye. Let her ſtoppe her eares vnto ſuche as tell her ill of her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / and thynke they do hit but to pyke a thanke. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myone / wyfe vnto Cadmus the kyng of Thebis / whan ſhe had gone from her huſbande moued by ieoloſy / ſhe complayneth and ſoroweth in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of Euripides the poet / ſayeng that moche re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſorte of women vnto her had vndone her / bycauſe
<pb facs="tcp:181141:111"/>ſhe had gyuen lyſtenynge and credence vnto thoſe ſklanderars. Therfore if a woman purpoſe to for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſake her huſbande for his concubynes / or els for to braule ſore with hym / let her call vnto reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance the wordes / that a certayne man ſpake ones / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he chaſed a fugityue ſeruaunt that he had / and he ran in to the backe houſe: I am glad ſayd he / to ſe the there as I wolde haue put the / and I hadde catched the: ſo let the wyfe thynke / that ſhe coude do nothyng that ſhulde more pleaſe her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des concubyne / than if ſhe ronne from her houſe and her huſbande / or elles be at debate with hym.

We rede in ſtoryes that yonge and newe maryed women / whan their huſbandes many tymes for the loue of huntynge hath layne out al night / they haue ſuſpected them with other women / and folowedde them in to the woddes and foreſtis / and there in the darke haue ben kylled with arrowes and torne with dogges / in the ſteade of wylde beaſtis / and ſuffered great payne for theyr curious ieoloſy. But howe moche more curteſly and wiſely dyd Tertia Emylia wyfe vnto Affricane the fyrſte / whiche whan ſhe ſawe that her huſbande had a fantaſye vnto one of her maydes / diſſembled the matter / leſte ſhe ſhulde ſeme to condempne of incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy the vanquiſſher of the worlde / and the prince of her countrey / and

This wyſe woman knewe well inough that ſhe was the wyfe &amp; the lady of the houſe / whether ſo euer her huſbande went. And if ſhe ſhulde beare any grut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che that her huſbande ſhulde lye with other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were but a fantaſye of bodely pleaſure / and nat of loue. Moreouer / if the wyfe ſhulde take diſpleaſure with her huſbande / ſhe ſhulde but pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoke him the more: and if ſhe ſuffre hym / ſhe ſhal the ſoner reclame hym / and ſpecially wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth perceyue and compare to gether her gentyll ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and his concubynes vnreaſonable pryde: for ſo Terence a peynter and declarer of the world is conditions wryteth in the comedye called Hecyra / that Panphilus was gotten frome Bacchis his concubyne / whom he loued ſo well / and brought a way his mynde vnto his wyfe / after that he had ones conſydered and knowen well hym ſelfe / and Bacchis / and his wyfe / that was at home / eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge bothe theyr maners as they were in dede / howe his wyfe was as an honeſte woman / ought to be / ſober / demure / and ſhamfaſt: and howe ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:181141:112"/>ſuffred all the harmes and wronges that her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de dyd vnto her / &amp; kepte her diſpleaſure in cloſe: than his mynde by lyttel and litle ouer comen par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly with pite / that he hadde on his wyfe / partlye with wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges done by Bacchis / fell clene out from Bacchis and tourned all his loue vnto his wyfe / ſeyng ſhe was of conditions accordynge to his ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petite. Thus ſayth Terence. Neyther I wyll let paſſe the dedes of that noble woman / whiche wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her huſbande was taken with loue of an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes wyfe / &amp; ſhe ſawe hym go dayly vnto her with ieoperdye of his lyfe / bycauſe of the womans huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande and her bretherne / that laye ſtyll in watche for hym / ſayd vnto her huſbande in this manere: Syr I ſe you can nat be gotten away from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of that woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / neither I wyll require that of you / I deſyre you only / that you loue nat with ſo great ieoperdye of your lyfe: ſhe ſayth ſhe wyll be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to goo with you. Therfore brynge her home vnto pour owne caſtell / and I ſhal leaue her all this the moſte goodlyeſt parte of the place / and go my ſelfe in to an other / &amp; I promyſe you of my fayth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate her none other wyſe / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myn owne ſyſter: if you fynde contrary / dryue me out of the houſe / and let her abyde. So in concluſyon ſhe perſuaded her huſbande: and vpon a nyght he brought his concubyne in to his caſtel / ſore tremblyng and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng her louers wyfe. But ſhe receyued her moſte gentelly and courteſlye / and brought her in to her chambre / nor neuer called her but ſyſter / and ſente vnto ger twys aday / &amp; commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ſhe ſhulde be

Than ſayde ſhe vnto her huſbande: Nowe may you vſe your loue with leſſe care &amp; ieoperdye. So / the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an holle yere came nat at his wyfe / whiche was both fayrer and more noble of byrth / and honeſte / and in all poyntes more goodly than his concubyne. What ſhe thought in her mynde / only god knoweth: but as farre as men coude per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue / ſhe toke no diſpleaſure with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter at all / ſpeciallye after ſhe hadde rydde her huſbande out of ieoperdye. Moche was ſhe in the churche / and moche in prayer / and euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knewe wel inough her trouble / but no man knewe that euer ſhe grut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playned. With in a yere / this man tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his mynde holly vnto his wyfe / and beganne to hate his concubyne deadly / and at the laſte put her away and ſet all his loue vpon his wyfe / in ſo moche / that euer after he ſayd / that al his mynde / his lyfe / and his harte was in her / and nowe he ſaith he wyll nat lyue lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge after / if it ſhulde chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce her to dye. I wyll nat name them / bicauſe they be both on lyue. Theſe examples haue I brought of them that haue an euident cauſe of ieoloſy. For as for them that be nat ſure of any cauſe / and be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable / and intollerable / and cauſe great vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acion / both vnto their ſelfe and vnto their huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / for an offence / that they wotte nat whether it be ſo or nat / as many do / whiche either loue inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatly / or folowe theyr owne fantaſyes ouer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che / they take lyght ſuſpeciouſnes and feble conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:113"/>for great and euident argumentes. If her huſbande bourde with a nother woman / lette nat the wyfe ſtreight ſuſpecte / that he loueth her. A great parte of this affection commeth of beleue / and ryſeth ofter of opinion and ſuſpection tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter in dede. Therfore let nat the woman be taken with euery lyght ſuſpection / whiche ought nat to be moued or agreued though ſhe knewe any thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in dede.</p>

Therfore you get no honore by your owne merites / but of other folkes curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: nor you be nat honored bycauſe you deſerue it / but bycauſe you ſore deſyre hit. For whan men ſe you be ſo gredy and deſyrous to haue honour / and that ſuche a ſmalle thynge deliteth you ſo moche / men be contente to do you that pleaſure / and calle you mayſtreſſes / and laugh vpon you / and ſpeke gentilly to you.

And hit is an honour and a prayſe for the men / bicauſe they ſet naught by theſe thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges: but bycauſe they knowe you be of ſuche appetite / no man rekeneth you the more honorable / bicauſe you be honored of the men / but rather rekeneneth them curteſe and gentyll / whiche do gyue honour vnto them / that they knowe be ſo lothe to lacke it. I am a man my ſelfe: nat withſtandyng / ſeyng I haue taken vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me to teache you / eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zele and charite that I bere towarde you / I wil neither hyde nor diſſemble any thyng / that I ſhal thynke dothe pertayne vnto your inſtruction and lernyng. Therfore will I open vnto you euen our ſerretes. Therfore I wolde ye ſhulde vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / that we do but laugh at you and mocke you / with that vayne coloure of honour / and the more deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that ye be of honour / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more we mocke you / and talke of you in diriſion / &amp; gyue vnto you abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly that pettiſſhenes / whiche you call honour. But we gyue hit nat for nought. For you gyue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne vnto vs no lyttle ſporte and delectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the folyſſhenes of your opinions and fantaſyes. Truely you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de nat / wher in very honour dothe ſtande. It is becomyng to deſerue honour / but nat to couete hit. For hit ſhulde folowe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue / &amp; nat be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted fore. Nowe it ſhalbe a ſigne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you / that you deſerue honour / whan you be nat agreued to be vnregarded. And that ſame thynge
<pb facs="tcp:181141:122"/>that we call honour / is of ſo frowarde nature and diſpoſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / that as philoſophers write / a Crocodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le doth ſo / hit foloweth them that flee / and fleeth from them that folowe hit: and is ſharpe to them that be gentyll to it / and gentyl vnto them that be ſharpe vnto hit. Socrates ſayth / there is no way more redy vnto honour / than by vertue: the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che alonly ſeketh for none honour / &amp; yet fyndeth it. Saluſte writeth / that Cato Vticenſis had leauer be good than ſeme good. Therfore ſaythe he / the leſſe that he ſought for honoure / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more it purſued vpon hym. Therfore the moſte ſure way vnto ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honour is vertue / whiche neither can lacke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour / nor taketh indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though it be diſpiſed. Flatterynges / gloſynges / &amp; fayre wordes / what woman ſo euer rekeneth them honour and preyſe / is worthy for her folly to haue none other honoure or prayſe. And yet there be ſome ſo madde / that thoughe they knowe them ſelfe but flattered / yet they wene they be prayſed. What you wretches / knowe you nat howe farre flattery differeth from prayſe? Wene you that is prayſe / whiche neither the perſon ſpeketh with his harte / and you knowe to / that it is falſe that he ſayth: and that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nat as he thynketh: but either to mocke you / or to diſceyue you with all? Beleue no man of your owne goodnes better than your ſelfe. And ſhe that ſercheth and knoweth her ſelfe well / fyndethe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng in her ſelfe at al / that is worthy any prayſe: But a mynde / whiche thynketh it ſelfe vnworthy any prayſe. If there be any goodnes / it cometh of
<pb facs="tcp:181141:122"/>god: and thanke hym therfore / gyue hym laudes and thanke. But if there be any euyll / it cometh of our owne vnhappynes. Wherfore the rebuke ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto our ſelfe / and the prayſe perteyneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a nother. Nowe ſeynge that worldly honour is of ſo ſmal price / it is a poynt of a vile mynde / to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uie worldly thynges vnto any other bodye. And if it be ſhame to enuie for honour / it is moche more ſhame to haue enuye at other for money / clothyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / or poſſeſſions / for yet is honour better than all they. Neither it is conuenient to haue enuie at other for theyr beautie / or theyr welfare / or plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous temyng: theſe be the gyftes of god / as al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goodnes be / that folkes haue. Wherfore they that enuie for theſe / ſeme nat to haue e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uie at them / that haue theſe thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges / but to blame god / whiche ſo diſtributeth his benyfytes. And me thynketh there is no more cauſe why / they ſhulde be enuied / that haue theſe / than they that carye bagage on a longe iourney. For what other thynges be the goodes of this worlde / but a troubleſome caryage and gardeuyaunce in this lyfe. Yea and worſte of all / they plucke downe with their weight vnto the erthe / myndes that be goynge towarde heuen. But if enuye be eſchewed / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall that vice light<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly be put away / whiche comonly ryſeth of enuye / that is ſute / chydynge / ſcoldynge / and makynge them ſelfe buſye aboute other folkes matters / to ſpie and ſerche what they do / what they ſay / howe &amp; by what meanes they lyue. Whiche thyng none honeſt woman will do / but ſuche as be ſhameleſſe / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:123"/>and worthye all kynde of rebuke: excepte they do hit of charite / to helpe them &amp; they lacke. For ſhe ought to helpe the poure man / and ſocoure the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane childe. Happy is ſhe / if that be her mynde: of whom the prophet ſpeketh i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pſalme of this wyſe: Bleſſed is he / that taketh vnderſtandynge and knowlege vpon a poure man: god ſhall dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hym in the euyll day: our lorde ſhall ſaue hym and quickene hym / and make hym happye vpon erthe: and ſhall nat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte hym to his ennemies wyll.

A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Lacedemon / take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ones pryſoner in warre / and aſked of her conquerer what ſhe coulde do: I can ſaid ſhe / rule an houſe. Ariſtotle ſayth / that in houſe kepynge / the mannes duetie is to get / and the womans to kepe. Wherfore nature ſemeth to haue made them fearefull for the ſame purpoſe / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:123"/>leſt they ſhulde be waſters / and hath gyuen them continual thought and care for lackyng. For if the woman be ouer free / the man ſhall neuer gette ſo moche as ſhe wyll waſte in ſhorte tyme: &amp; ſo their houſe muſte nedes ſone decaye. Hit is nat becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge for an honeſte wyfe to be a great ſpender. Nor they be lyghtly no great ſparers of theyr ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty / that be ſo large of theyr money / as Saluſt ſaythe by Sempronia / whiche ſet more price by any other thynge / than ſhe dyd by her worſhip or her money. For a man coulde nat well perceyue / whether ſhe regarded leſſe her money or her good name. Howe be it / I wolde nat haue the woman to be to great a nygarde of her goodes / or to let her huſbande to diſtribute his money vnto holy vſe. In ſo moche that what penye ſomeuer cometh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with in her coffer / ſhulde neuer fynde way out agayne: as though it were locked in Labyrynth / or Dankes toure: as many women do / whiche haue no diſcreſſion / howe they ſhulde ſaue &amp; kepe a thynge. Therfore the Eſſens wolde take no wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with them vnto that holy and religious lyfe / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the they ledde: bycauſe the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> coude nat away with that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monalte of goodes. For what ſo euer a woman ſeeth ones in her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / ſhe can nat ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre it to go away agayne. Therfore let her vſe her houſeholde to ſobrenes and meaſure. For that is more the womans duetye than the mannes. But ſo yet / that ſhe haue diſcreſſion betwent meaſure and auaryce / and ſobernes and nygardeſhyppe. For it is nat all one to lyue ſoberly / and be hungre.
<pb facs="tcp:181141:124"/>Therfore let her ſe that her houſe holde lacke nat neyther meate nor clothe. In whiche poynte / I wolde ſhe ſhulde here Ariſtotles opinion. Ther be ſayth he .iii. thynges / worke / meate / and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: meate without correction and worke, maketh them proude and wanton: and worke and correcti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on without meate / is a cruell entreatyng / and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth the ſeruantes weake and feble. Therfore let the wyfe gyue her ſeruauntes / worke to do / and ſufficient meate / as is a ſeruauntes duetie. But let her ordre all thynge after her huſbandes wyll and commaundement: or at the leaſt in ſuche wiſe as ſhe thynketh that her huſbande wyl be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent: neither be rough and harde with her meyny / but gentyll and fauorable: and as ſaynt Hieronyme ſaythe / more lyke a mother than a mayſtres: and rather optayne reuerence of them with mekenes / than rygorouſnes. Where vnto ſhe maye ſhortely come by the wayes of vertue. For as for chidyng / braulyng / rayllyng / ſcoldyng / and fyghting / doth neither cauſe auctorite nor reuerence / but rather hyndreth them. But wyſedome / diſcretion / ſadde conditions / and grauite of wordes and ſentences / bryngeth all thyng better to paſſe / than hedynes and violence. For we feare more them that be wiſe and diſcrete / than them that be angry and haſty. And a quiete rule maye do more than rygorous. For quietnes is of more auctorite than haſty bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emnes. Howe be hit I wolde nat wyues ſhulde be ſluggyſhe and ſlouthfull / but I counſaile them to vſe reuerent grauite / and neyther ſytte ſo ſtyll as

And if a ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t haue done lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſeruiſe in her houſe / lette her take hym none other wyſe than as her brother / or her ſonne. We loue cattes and dogges / that haue bene noryſſhed any while in our houſes: than howe moche more faith fully ought we to ſhewe that fauour vnto our eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chriſten. Alſo ſeruauntes agayne on theyr partie muſte be warned / to remembre the ſayeng of ſaint Paule / that they do their dutie diligently / meke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / and buxomly / yea and merily to / and pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly: nor bable / nor murmoure agayne: neither ſhewe any diſpleaſant countenaunce / leſte they leſe the thanke of theyr labour / bothe afore god and man. Alſo kepe theyr handes pure from pyckynge and ſtealynge. In the whiche poynt all wylde beaſtis be more kynde than many folkes. For what wilde beaſte is ſo outragious / that wil plucke away any thyng of his profet / by whom he hath be nouriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and brought vp: and quite hym with ſuche a tourne / of whom he hath had ſo many pleaſures. Howe be it no body doth ſo / but they that be of vile ſtomackes / and euen worthy to be bondes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeruyng maydes ſhall loue and worſhip theyr maiſters and mayſtreſſes / none other wyſe / than thoughe they were theyr fathers and mothers. For the nouryſſher and brynger vp is as a father.
<pb facs="tcp:181141:125"/>Let the ſeruynge maydes neyther ſay nor do any thyng / whereof the good wyfe of the houſe or her doughters may take any example of yll. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes gyuynge yll example is worſe than the dede hit ſelfe. But nowe to ſpeake of the wyues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. Obedience and ſeruice optayned by fayre meanes / is more faithfull and pleaſant / than that whiche is gotten with feare. For I wolde all feare ſhulde be away / but nat obedience. Let nat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres be ouer pleaſant of ſpeche to her men ſeruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes / neither compenable and mery / nor vſe moche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſacion with them / nor bolde none of them to play and dalye with her.

And bicauſe the buſynes and charge with in the houſe lyeth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the womans hande / I wold ſhe ſhulde knowe medycines and ſalues for ſuche diſeaſis as be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men / and rayne almoſt dayly: and haue thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicynes euer prepared redy in ſome cloſette / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe maye helpe her huſbande / her lytle chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren / &amp; her houſe holde meyny / whan any nedeth /

A vertuous wyfe / whan ſhe hath ryd her houſeholde charge and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynes / ſhall euery day ones / if ſhe may / or at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt on the holy dayes / get her ſelfe in to ſome ſecreate corner of her houſe / out of companye: and there for a whyle / lay a part out of her my<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de all care and thought of her houſe: and ther with a quiet my<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de gatheryng her wyttes and reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto her / diſpiſe theſe worldly thynges as tryffels / frayle / and vnſure: and that ſone ſhall vanyſſhe awaye / and bicauſe the length of our lyfe is ſo ſhorte / and paſſeth ſo ſwiftely / that hit ſemeth nat to be led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye but plucked awaye / neyther to departe / but flye awaye. After this / let her lyfte vp her mynde vnto the ſtudye and contemplatyon of heuenlye thynges / by ſome holy redynge: than confeſſe her
<pb facs="tcp:181141:128"/>ſynnes vnto almighty god / and deſyre mekely per done and peace of hym: and pray fyrſt for her ſelfe: and than / whan ſhe is in more fauour with god / for her huſbande: and than for her children: and after for all her houſe holde: that our lorde Ieſus of his grace wolde inſpire good mynde in to them. Saynt Paule / the meſſanger of almyghty god / where he informed and taught the churche of the Corinthyans / begynnyng ſayth in this wyſe: If any man haue a wyfe that is an infidell / if ſhe be content to tarye with hym / let hym nat put her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye. And if any Chriſten woman haue an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande an infidell / if he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to dwell with her / ler her nat go from hym. For the man / that is an infidell / ſhall be bleſſed by his faythfull wyfe: and the woman that is an infidell / ſhall be bleſſed by her faithfull huſbande. For what canſte thou tell woman / whether thou ſhalte be cauſe of thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes ſaluation? Or what canſte thou tell man / whether thou ſhalte be cauſe of thy wyues ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Whiche ſayeng prayneth partely vnto pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer.

Whiche thyng ſaynt Peter the apoſtle ſheweth / where he ſaythe: Lyke wyſe women / be you ſubgettes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your huſbandes / that they that will nat beleue the worde / maye be wonne without the worde / by their wyues conuerſacion / whanne they conſyder your demeanoure in holye feare. I haue redde of many Chriſten women / whiche by theyr meanes

And greatteſt philoſophers agre in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon / that women beare no children more longe of them ſelfe than of theyr huſbandes. For nature neuer broughte forthe but very fewe baren men / and many women. And that vpon great conſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration / bicauſe there is more loſſe in the barennes of the man / than of the woman. For there cometh more increaſe in generation by the man / than by the woman. Wherfore woman / if the barennes be in the / thou doteſt vngraciouſly in vayne: for ther ſhall neuer man get the with chylde. And ſo thou conceiueſt many vngratious dedes in thy mynde: but thou ſhalte neuer conceyue any frute in thy wombe. And many tymes by the ryghtous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of god / vnknowen vnto vs / there commeth none iſſue in mariage. For lyke as hit is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyfre of

Suche children do they optayne / that ſo aſke. For they that be conceyued of ſynne and wickednes / can be naught elles / but vngratiouſnes. The wordes of the angell vnto Sampſons mother be theſe. Thou art baren and without children: howe be it thou ſhalte conceyue &amp; beare a ſonne. Therfore ſe thou drynke neyther

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the philyſtyns. Theſe wordes put me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce nowe / to gyue women with chylde warnyng / that ſo longe as they be great / they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eate ſo moche to take ſurfet of / nor drynke to be drounke with. For many chyldren haue after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame thynges / that theyr mothers delited in / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were with chylde with them. Nowe for to declare / what diligence oughte to be gyuen to chyldren in the bryngynge vp of them / were to longe to be comprehended in this boke / if I ſhulde teache euery thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g at large. Wherof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny counnyng men / both of olde tyme &amp; late / haue write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moche in bokes made purpoſely for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame matter.

               <p>Fyrſte of all / let the mother reken her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be all her treaſure. There came vpon a tyme a great ryche woman vnto Rome / out of the countrey of Campanya / whiche was hoſted and lodged with the noble woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cornelia / wyfe of Gracchus: ther this ryche woman ſhewed out her great treaſure vnto Cornelia / abundaunde of ſyluer and golde / ryche raymentes / and precious ſtones: Whiche whan Cornelia had preyſed / than deſired this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Campany / that ſhe wolde do ſo moche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne / as ſhewe her treaſure: Cornelia anſwered / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:131"/>that ſhe wolde do ſo at nyght. Nowe were her chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren gone to ſchole / and were nat yet comen home. So at nyght / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chyldren were come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home / ſhe ſhewed them vnto this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / and ſayd: theſe be my chiefe treaſure. Another tyme a certayne woman of Ionia / made great boſte and ſhewe of glorious clothes / of great price and goodly worke / Cornelia ſayd: this woman maketh great boſt of her clothes / but my foure ſonnes, indued with all kynde of vertue / be vnto me in ſteade of precious clothes / with coſtly worke / and all treaſure. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in kepyng of this treaſure / and increaſyng it / there is no labour to be refuſed. Loue ſhall make all labour lyght and eaſye. Wherfore ſhe ſhall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſhe them with her owne mylke: and obey the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement of nature / whiche gyuyng .ij. brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis with mylke / vnto euery woman delyuered of childe / ſemeth to crye and byd euery woman / that hath borne childe / to kepe childe as other lyuynge creatures do. Alſo that wyſe and lyberall mother of all thyng / Nature hath tourned all that blode / whiche wente vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nouriſſhement of the childe / whyle hit was in the mothers wombe / after that the chylde is borne / ſhe ſendeth hit vppe vnto the breaſtis / tourned into whyte mylke / to nouriſſhe the childe with all: neither forſaketh the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be / after that it is borne / but nouriſſheth hit with the ſame fode / where of ſhe hath made hit. But I haue ſpoken inough of this matter in the boke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. After wardes / if the mother can ſkyll of ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng / let her teache her litle children her ſelfe / that
<pb facs="tcp:181141:132"/>they maye haue all one / bothe for theyr mother / theyr nouryſe / and theyr teacher. And that they may loue her alſo the more / and lerne with better corage / and more ſpede / by the meanes of the loue / that theyr teacher hath towarde them. As for her daughters / ſhe ſhall beſyde the lernyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boke / inſtructe them alſo with womennes craftes: as to handle wolle &amp; flexe / to ſpynne / to weaue / to ſowe / to rule and ouer ſe an houſe. Neyther a vertuous mother ought to refuſe lernynge on the boke / but nowe and than ſtudye and rede holy and wyſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bokes: and though ſhe do it nat for her owne ſake / at the leaſt wyſe for her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / that ſhe may teache them / and make them good: As Euridice / whan ſhe was of great age / ſette her ſelfe vnto ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge / and ſtudy of philoſophy / onely to thentent / that ſhe myght teache her children: and ſo ſhe did. For the babe fyrſte hereth her mother / and fyrſte begynneth to enforme her ſpeche after hers. For that age can do nothyng it ſelfe / but cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfet and folowe other: and is counnyng in this thing only. She taketh her fyrſt conditions and information of mynde / by ſuche as ſhe hereth / or ſeeth by her mother. Therfore it lyeth more in the mother / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meu wene / to make the conditions of the children. For ſhe maye make them whether ſhe wyll / very good / or very badde. Nowe howe ſhe ſhall make them good / I wyll gyue a fewe ſhorte rules. Let her gyue her diligence / at leaſt wiſe by cauſe of her children / that ſhe vſe no rude and blounte ſpeche / leſt that maner of ſpekyng take ſuche route in the
<pb facs="tcp:181141:132"/>tender myndes of the children / and ſo growe &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe together with theyr age / that they can nat forget it. Children wyll lerne no ſpeche better / nor more play<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly expreſſe / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they will their mothers. For they wyll counterfete both the vertue and the vice / if any be in it. Iames / the kyng of Aragone / after that he had wonne my countre Valence / out of the handes of the Agarenes / whiche inhabited the citie that tyme / he droue out the people / and commaunded men of Aragon / and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da to go dwell in hit. So the children that came of them bothe / with all theyr poſterite / kepte theyr mothers language: whiche we ſpeke there vnto this daye. For the ſpace of more than .ij. hundred and .l. yere. Tyberius Gracchus / &amp; Gayus Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus / were cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the moſt eloquent me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome / and they lerned it of their mother Cornelia / whoſe epiſtols were red in the olde worlde / full of pure elo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quence. Iſtrina the quene of Scythia / wyfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to kyng Aripithis / taught her ſon Syles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greke tonge. Alſo Plato commandeth / that nurces ſhall nat vſe to tell vnto children vayne and tryflyng fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. This ſame thynge is to be charged vnto the mothers tonge. For by the reaſon of ſuche bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng vp: ſome / after they be come to ſadder age / haue ſuche childyſſhe and tender ſtomackes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they can nat abyde to here any thyng of wiſedome or ſadnes / but delyte all together in bokes of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſſhe fables / whiche neither be true / nor lykelye. Therfore mothers ſhall haue redy at hande plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant hiſtories and honeſt tales / of the comendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:181141:133"/>of vertue / and rebukynges of vice. And lette the childe here thoſe fyrſt: and whan it can nat yet tell what is good and what is badde / it ſhall begynne to loue vertue and hate vice: and ſo growe vp and waxe with thoſe opinyons: and ſhall go about to be lyke vnto them / whom he hath harde his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende: &amp; vnlyke vnto thoſe / who ſhe hath diſprayſed. The mother ſhall reherſe vnto them the laudes of vertue / and the diſprayſe of vice / and repete ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes / to dryue them in to the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s remembraunce. I wolde ſhe ſhulde haue ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſayenges and preceptes of lyuynge commenly in vſe / whiche harde dyuers tymes / ſhall at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſte abyde in the childrens reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce / though they gyue no hede vnto them. For children rounne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theyr mother / and aſke her aduiſe in all thyng: they inquite euery thyng of her: what ſome euer ſhe anſwereth / they beleue and regarde and take hit euen for the goſpell. O mothers what an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be you vnto your children / to make them whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther you wyll / good or badde? Than ſhulde ryght and good opinions / and the pure fayth of Chriſte be enfunded in to theyr myndes / to diſpiſe riches / power / honour / pompe / nobilite / and beautie / and to reken them for vayne and foliſſhe thynges: but iuſtice / deuotion / boldenes / co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynence / counnyng / mekenes mercye / and charite with mankynde / to reken theſe thynges goodly / and worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and vſed: and to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te them the true &amp; ſure goodes. Neither to haue in honour ſuche men / in whom thoſe thynges be / that we ſpake of before / 
<pb facs="tcp:181141:133"/>but in whom theſe be. What ſomeuer ſhall be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of any man / or done wiſely / wyttyly / or honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / let her prayſe it vnto them.

But if any body ones name theſe other thynges / they abhorre them as vnluckye ſygnes. And therfore theſe lye vnder fete / and be diſpyſed.

<pb facs="tcp:181141:134"/>and all men rounneth vnto them. For whereof I praye you commeth this / that we haue ſo many leude felowes and fooles / and ſo fewe good &amp; wyſe men? Whan that the good nature of mankynde is more inclined of it owne ſelfe vnto vertue / than vnto vice. Therfore a good wyfe ſhall withſtande theſe corrupted opinions / with other better / and more mete for Chriſten folkes: and ſhall nouriſſhe vp in her children that lyttell fyre / that I ſpake of before: and water thoſe ſedes with the droppes of good teachynge / that the fyre maye ryſe vp vnto great lyght / and the ſedes vnto moche and good corne.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde that is the moſte vile and the leaſt worthe / that the mother loueth moſt tenderly. If you will beloued in dede of your children / and ſpecially in that age / whan they knowe what is true and holy loue / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make them nat to loue you ouer moche / whan they knowe nat yet what loue is: but ſette more by a ſpiſed cake / a hunnye combe / or a pece of

No mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loued her childe better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myne dyd me: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any chylde dyd euer leſſe perceyue hym ſelfe loued of his mother than I.

And whan I was comen home / I coulde nat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue that euer ſhe longed for me. Therfore was ther no body / that I more fled / or was more lothe to come nyghe / than my mother / whan I was a childe. But after I came to yonge ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes eſtate / there was no body / whom I delited more to haue in ſyghte. Whoſe memorye nowe I haue in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence / &amp; as afte as ſhe cometh to my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / I enbrace her with in my mynde and thoughte / whan I can nat with my body. I had a frende at Paris / a very well lerned man: Whiche amonge other great benefites of god / rekened this for one: that his mother was deade / that ſheryſſhed hym ſo wonderouſly: Whiche (ſayd he) if ſhe had lyued / I had neuer come to Paris to lerne: But had ſyt ſtyll at home all my lyfe / amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge dicyng / drabbes / delycates / and pleaſures / as I begounne. Howe coude this man loue his mother / that was ſo glad of her dethe? But a wyſe mother ſhall nat wyſſhe for pleaſures vnto her childe / but vertue? Nor for ryches / but for counnyng / and good fame. And ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an honeſt dethe / than for an vncomly lyfe.

And we rede in hiſtories / that many of them haue kylled with theyr owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / theyr ſonnes / that were cowar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des and daſtardes / pronouncyng theſe wordes:</p>

               <p>Sophia whiche had .iij. goodly daughters / na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them with .iij. names of vertue / hope / faith / and charite / and was very glad to ſe them all dye for the honour of Chriſte / &amp; buried them her owne ſelfe / nat farre from Rome / in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of Hadryan themperour. Let nat the mothers be ſo dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in teachynge theyr children craftes to gette good by / as to make them vertuous. Neither ſhall bydde them take exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of ſuche as haue gathered mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che goodes in ſhorte ſpace: but rather of ſuche as haue comen vnto great vertue and goodnes. The people of Megara is diſpreyſed / and nat without a cauſe / for teachyng theyr children nygardſhyppe and couetyſe: and in ſtede of honeſt children / made them ſparynge bonde men. Wherfore they cauſed ſuche thynges / as weſe chaunſeth nowe adayes / that with byddyng them ſo ofte / ſeke for good / get good / increaſe theyr good / and gether good by all meanes / they cauſed their children to do myſchiefe &amp; vngratious dedes. The whiche faute is a great parte in the fathers and mothers / whiche be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaylours / cauſers / and ſetters vpon / and as good reaſon was / whan the children coulde fynde none other wayes to come by ryches / they robbed their fathers and mothers. And if they ſawe that all
<pb facs="tcp:181141:137"/>was ſo well and cloſely layde vp / that they coulde nat come by it / than begou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne they to hate theyr fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers and mothers / and wyſſhe for theyr dethes / and ſeke meanes to rydde them away. And hit is playnly knowen / that many haue poyſoned theyr fathers &amp; mothers / bycauſe they thought to lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge / to tarry tyll they dyed for age. Often tymes they rebuke theyr fathers and mothers of theyr owne vices / as though they had lerned them by theyr example or neglygence. For the vnthrifty yonge man / whiche had an vnthrifty father / ſayd of this faſſyon: I wyll impute myne vnthriftynes vnto my father. For I was nat brought vp with ſadde meanour / neither vnder the lawe of a well ordered houſe / whiche moughte haue inſtructed my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners better / &amp; plucked me from thoſe vices / that myne age was inclyned to. But whan that fyrſte age of children ought to be holden vnder / &amp; kepte in by ſad orderyng / leſt it fall vnto vice / through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer mothe libertie / from whiche it will be harde to plucke them agayne: and as the wyſe man coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayleth / neuer haue the rodde of the boyes backe: ſpecially the daughters ſhulde be handled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cheryſſhyng. For cheryſſhyng marreth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonnes / but hit vtterly diſtroyeth the daughters. And me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be made worſe with ouer moche libertie / but the women be made vngratious. For they be ſo ſet vpon pleaſures and fantaſyes / that excepte they be well brydled and kepte vnder / they rounne on heed in to a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de myſcheffes. Nowe howe the daughters oughte to be brought vp / I haue
<pb facs="tcp:181141:137"/>ſhewed in the boke afore. Therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother ſhall rede hit / bothe bycauſe there be many thynges pertaynynge vnto maryed women / and bycauſe hit is the mothers dutie / to ſe that the doughters do that we teache there. And whan the mothers haue prouided as well as they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by wordes / that no foule / vncomely / or vnclenly thynge / or ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous / or vngratious abyde in the childes mynde / than ſhall they prouide moſte of all / both by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and dedes / that the childe ſe nothynge / whiche can nat he counterfeted &amp; folowed without ſhame. For as I ſayd before / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> age is euen almoſt lyke an ape / and doth nothynge of it ſelfe / but all by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfetynge of other. And though the fathers and mothers by their auctorite and loue / and alſo com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement / put the ill examples of other folkes out of the chyldrens myndes / yet they can nat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke that they do them ſelfe: or though they wold rebuke it / yet wyll nat children be ſo moche moued with that / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they here / as with that / that they ſe. Wherfore the poet Iuuenall ſaythe full well / that thexamples of fathers &amp; mothers / may do more / than a great deale of warnyng and teachyng / of a great ſorte of maiſters: for they ſhal do them more hurte by thexample of one ill dede / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue done them good by moche holy counſaylyng. And therfore the afore ſayd poet counſayleth wyfely in the .xiiii. Satyre on this maner.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be required more perfite in a woman than a man.

And whan it were conue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyent / that all Chriſten me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhulde be as bretherne to the in beniuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and charite / thou hateſt thoſe / that be conioyned vnto the in houſe and blode / and that be bretherne vnto thy chyldren.

Do you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / you ſtepmothers that be ſuche / that your vnruely ire and hate commeth but of the dreames of your owne folly. For why do nat ſtepfathers hate theyr wyues childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in lyke maner? For there is no ſtep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>father / but heloueth his wyues ſaie as wel as his owne. I haue redde of many ſtepfathers / that hath gyuen the inheritance of realmes vnto their wyues ſonnes / euen as they had bene their owne / as Auguſtus ſefte thempyre of Rome vnto Tybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius / and Claudius vnto Nero <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And yet had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus childrens childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; childre of them agaye: and Claudins had a ſonne.

But wherto ſhulde I ſay any thyng of the ſtepfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers loue / whan there be ſome mothers ſo mad / that they wene theyr huſbandes loue nat theyr owne naturall children / bycauſe they do nat trifle and fole with them all the daye and all the nyghte ſtyll / as them ſelfe doth. Man can nat dote as the woman can. For that ſame ſtronge ſtomake of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can holde and couer loue well inough / and ruleth it / and dothe nat obey hit. But you ſtepmothers / why do nat you euer kyſſe / combe / and pyke your ſtepchildren / as you do your owne: ther is ſo great darkenes of myſty fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſies i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your my<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what ſo euer you loue / you thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke euery body ſhulde loue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame / &amp; that no man loueth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> inough: and what ſo euer you hate / you thinke is worthy to be hated of euery man / and that euery body loueth that to moche. And ſome there be / whiche wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they hate theyr ſtepſonnes deadly / yet they ſwere they loue them: whiche be madde / and if they beleue / that any man wyll beleue them: And yet they be more

Of this cauſe maye come honeſt wepynge / ſorowe / and mournynge / with good occaſion / and waylynge nat to blame.

Alſo after that Lucrecia was ſlayne in Rome / whan Iunius Brutus / whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che was reuengeor of her dethe and rape / done by the kynges ſonne / had dryuen the kynges out of Rome / and warre was made agaynſt the kynge: In the fyrſt ſettynge together / this Brutus was kylde / and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyues of the cite mourned a twelue moneth the deth of hym / that had be the defender of their chaſtite.

Tha howe moche more oughteſt thou to mourne the deth of hym / that is the defender of thyne owne chaſtite / ſauer and ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of thy body / father and tutour of thy children / welthe of thy houſe / houſeholde / and thy goodes / yea and more to / thy gouernour &amp; lorde? And thou woldeſt wepe in dede / if thou ſhuldeſt nat departe rycher from hym / than thou cameſt to hym. But nowe the ioye of money / taketh away all the grefe of thy ſorowe. Thou woldeſt wepe for his dethe / if thou haddeſt loued hym / whan he was on lyue. But nowe thou art nat ſorye for his departynge / whom thou ſetteſt nothyng by / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haddeſt hym. Alſo many be glad / that theyr huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone

Here parauenture ſome wolde ſay / He was ſuche an huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de / that better were to be without hym / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue hym. But ſo wolde neuer good woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay / nor yll kepe it in. For if he were of the beloued as the lawes of god do commaunde / he ſhulde be / that is to ſay / as he were thy ſelfe: thou wolde be as ſorye that he ſhulde dye / as thy ſelfe. Vnto an il woman / excepte her huſbande let her haue her It<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berte to all vices / that her mynde lyeth to / he is in tollerable. But vnto a good woman / no huſbande can be ſo yll / that ſhe ne had leauer haue his lyfe than his dethe. But what ſhulde I ſpeake moche of this matter? I haue ſhewed inough in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boke a fore / that ſhe is neither worthy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of a good woman nor wyfe / that can nat loue her huſbande with all her harte / as her ſelfe. O circumſpecte na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture / or rather god / the mooſte wyſe mayſter of all good maners. There is no kynde of vertue / but
<pb facs="tcp:181141:150"/>he hath created ſome lyuyng thyng / that vſeth it / for to reprehende &amp; reproue thoſe that diſpice that vertue: as bees by theyr crafte reproue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leudnes of them / that can nothyng do: And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfulnes of dogges damneth the vntruſtynes of fals peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: ſhepe condemne fraudes and gyles with their ſymplenes: ſtockedoues and turtuls gyue exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of true &amp; faithfull loue / in mariage. For thoſe byr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / as Ariſtole ſayth / lyue content with one male nor take none other. The turtle doue / whanne her male is deade / neither drynketh lyquore / nor ſyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the grene tre ne commeth amonge none of her felowes playenge &amp; ſportyng together. Theſe chaſt and holy loues meaneth Solomon / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he calleth his ſpouſe to hym / ſayeng: The voyce of a turtle doue is harde in our realme: And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth his ſpouſe ſome tymes to a turtell / and ſome tyme to a ſtocke douue. Alſo they that can haue no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in theyr wepyng and mournyng / be as farre to blame on thother ſyde. For whan they be newly wounded with the chaunce / they confounde and fyll all the place full of cryeng / &amp; teare their heare / beate theyr breaſtis / and ſkratche theyr chekes / &amp; knocke theyr heddes to the walles / &amp; their bodyes to the grounde / and drawe forth longe the tyme of theyr mournynge / as in Secill / Aſia / Grece / and Rome: in ſo moche / that the ſenate was fayne to make ſtatutes and lawes / whiche was called the lawes of the twelue tables / for to modyfie and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the mournyng. And therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtle alſo / whan he wrote to this people / was compelled to
<pb facs="tcp:181141:150"/>comforte them / ſayenge: Bretherne / I wolde ye ſhulde haue knowlege of thoſe that ſlepe / that ye be nat ſory and pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyfe / lyke other people that haue no faythe. For if we beleue that Ieſus is deade / and reuyued agayne: ſo ſhall god lyke wyſe bryng agayne with hym al that be deade by him. Nowe a wydowe / let her bewayle her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affection / and nat crye out / nor vexe nat her ſelfe with daſſhyng of her handes / neither beatynge of her body: but let her ſo mourne / that ſhe reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre ſobernes &amp; meaſure / that other may vnderſtande her ſorowe / without her owne hoſty<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; vtterau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And after that the fyrſt bro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te of her ſorowe is paſt and ſwaged / than let her begynne to ſtudy for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Nowe here will I nat brynge forthe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes out of the longe volumes of philoſophers. For my purpoſe is to inſtructe a Chriſten woman with Chriſtis philoſophy: in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paryſon of whom / all mannes wy ſedome is but folye. My mynde is to ſeche a remedy. Let vs reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayeng of the apoſtle / that they whiche ſlepe with Ieſu / ſhall be brought of god with Ieſu agayne. Wherfore we ought to be of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte. And ſhe that is a wyſe woman / let her remembre that all men be borne / and lyue in this lawe and condition / to paye theyr duete vnto nature / as theyr creditoure / whan ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhe aſketh it / of ſome ſoner / of ſome later: howe be it all be coupled with in the comon lot and rate / to be borne / &amp; lyue / and dye: but our ſoules be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal / and this lyfe is but a departyng in to a no ther eternall lyfe and bleſſed / to them that haue

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory lyfe. The whiche thyng the Chriſten faythe maketh eaſye inough / nat by our deſarte and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite / but of his goodnes / the whiche with his deth loſed vs from the ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of dethe: and deth of this lyfe is but as a ſayly<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g out of the ſee in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hauyn.

For ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kynde hath ſpeche to couple wyſedome &amp; vertue to gether: &amp; though it ſeme to do no more but vtter the thought of the mynde / yet doth it cauſe bothe lernynge &amp; vertue.

Therfore a woman had nede to worke more ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / whan bothe the diſprayſe of vices and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayſe of vertue is imputed to her ſelfe.

<pb facs="tcp:181141:156"/>and if we do ill / it is to be referred to our ſelfe.
